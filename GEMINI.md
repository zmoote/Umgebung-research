## Project Overview

This repository, `Umgebung-research`, is the central collection of research materials for the "Umgebung" project. The goal of this project, as outlined in the `Personal` directory, is to create an interactive 3D desktop application to simulate reality. This simulation is not based on mainstream scientific consensus, but rather on the ideas of "fringe" thinkers, extraterrestrial contactees, and other alternative sources.

The project aims to model concepts such as consciousness, the soul, creation, and vibrational density, alongside established physics like quantum and classical mechanics. The development will leverage NVIDIA technologies, including PhysX and CUDA, for a Windows-based application.

## Directory Analysis

The repository is organized into four main directories, each serving a distinct purpose in the research and development of the "Umgebung" project.

### `Computation`

This directory contains technical resources for the implementation of the "Umgebung" simulation. It includes programming guides for CUDA and C++, books on game engine architecture and real-time rendering, and academic papers on using CMake for large-scale software projects. A key file in this directory is `Haramein-Essonne Model.csv`, which appears to be a foundational document for the physics of the simulation, attempting to unify concepts from the Standard Model and cosmology with the work of Nassim Haramein and Chris Essonne.

### `Other`

This directory is a collection of supplementary research materials that provide broader context for the project. It includes university-level physics textbooks, notes on crystal science, and documents related to UFOs and extraterrestrial contact. This mix of mainstream and alternative science suggests a wide-ranging and eclectic research approach.

### `Personal`

This directory contains personal notes and documents related to the "Umgebung" project and the user's academic work. Key files include:

*   `Zach wants to create an interactive.txt`: A detailed description of the project's goals, the thinkers to be referenced, and the technologies to be used.
*   `Potential Classes For Umgebung.txt`: A list of potential C++ classes for the 3D application, such as `Camera`, `Shader`, and `Model`.
*   `PHY 420 13534 Syllabus Capstone Projects I Fall 2025.docx` and `PHY-420 Capstone Projects I Mid Semester Written Report Moote.docx`: Documents related to the user's Capstone project, for which "Umgebung" is likely the focus.
*   Hardware specifications and chat histories.

### `Thinkers`

This is the most extensive directory, containing the core theoretical research for the "Umgebung" project. It is organized by individual thinkers, whose ideas will form the basis of the simulation's model of reality. The directory includes a large collection of books, articles, notes, and transcripts from the following individuals:

*   **Alex Collier**: Material on extraterrestrial contact.
*   **Billy Carson**: Directory present, but currently empty.
*   **Chris Essonne**: Research papers on gravity, mechanics, and quantum theory.
*   **Dan Willis**: Presentation slides.
*   **Dani Henderson**: Text on alien technology.
*   **Elena Danaan**: Extensive collection of books, notes, and transcripts on extraterrestrial contact and related subjects.
*   **Masaru Emoto**: The book "The Hidden Messages in Water."
*   **Nassim Haramein**: Research papers on quantum gravity and holographic mass.
*   **Randall Carlson**: Transcript on sacred geometry and ancient knowledge.
*   **Sacha Stone**: Directory present, but currently empty.
*   **Tom Campbell**: The "My Big TOE" trilogy on consciousness.

## Usage

This repository serves as the knowledge base for the "Umgebung" project. The primary use case is to read, analyze, and synthesize the information contained within these documents to inform the design and implementation of the 3D simulation. The user may ask questions about specific topics, authors, or papers to aid in this process.
