I want to create an interactive 3D desktop application, called "Umgebung," with the goal of simulating reality.
The challenge with this is that I am searching for the absolute, ultimate truth; Not what the mainstream media has been brainwashing us to believe is the "truth."
This means learning everything I can from "fringe" thinkers, extraterrestrial contactees, supernatural experiencers, etc., and modeling the information within an object-oriented framework.
This would include topics like Consciousness, Soul, Creation, Vibrational Density, but also Quantum Mechanics, Classical Mechanics and such.

I will be utilizing NVIDIA's PhysX (CUDA accelerated), CUDA, multithreading, and any libraries or dependencies that could help me with this project.

This project will only support Windows as the OS (Windows 10/11), and NVIDIA GPUs.
 
The individuals I have in mind to learn and reference from currently are including but not limited to:

Alex Collier (https://alexcollier.org)
Elena Danaan (https://elenadanaan.org)
Dani Henderson (https://galacticspiritualinformers.com)
Nassim Haramein (https://nassimharamein.com/)
Chris Essonne (https://www.gsjournal.net/Science-Journals-Papers/Author/2334/Chris,%20Essonne)
Dan Willis (https://thewebmatrix.net)
Tony Rodrigues (https://tonyrodrigues.com)

The scale I am imagining is going to present a challenge.

1 Multiverse
	100^100 Universes
		200 Billion - 3000 Trillion Galaxies per Universe
			300 Billion Stars per Galaxy
