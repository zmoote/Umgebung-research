Heat.

Hello everyone. Here I'm back from

00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:23,040
How are you everyone?

00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:27,280
Can you hear me well? Everyone here

00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:31,360
before I go forward, welcome to this

12
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:35,760
17th webinar and Q&A.

13
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:39,599
So I'm really happy today to share with

14
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:43,360
you some topic which is very important,

15
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:47,920
very crucial. First look at this

16
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:52,000
beautiful fan. Um it's written the heart

17
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:55,920
of creator and this is absolutely on

18
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:59,680
topic tonight. Um I bought this

19
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:02,879
beautiful uh Japanese fan in the Shinto

20
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:08,800
shrine. So I love it that it's written

21
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:12,560
the heart of the creator or God. Um so I

22
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:15,280
I will talk about my trip to Singapore

23
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:18,640
and Japan and everything I've discovered

24
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:20,400
and experienced there in further videos.

25
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:25,120
So for the moment let's concentrate

26
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:28,640
tonight in a fabulous topic, the nature

27
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:32,480
of the soul and consciousness.

28
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:36,640
First before um starting this topic I

29
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:38,879
would like to thank from the bottom of

30
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:44,879
my heart

00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:48,480
um all my family of heart and soul who

32
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:53,440
have been supporting me these last days

33
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:57,120
who have been um very close to me um

34
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:59,680
helping me going through these days. So

35
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,280
my love is for you.

36
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:05,439
Uh

37
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:07,040
well um this said

38
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:10,319
I've

39
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:14,159
been very impressed by

40
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:16,880
by the the the welcoming

41
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:19,199
I received in Japan.

42
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:21,759
I was invited to this conference in

43
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:25,440
Tokyo organized by Moko Sano. I think

44
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:27,360
she's in the chat. Hi Moko. I miss you

45
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:30,320
already.

46
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:33,360
Um, I miss already all the Japanese

47
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:36,360
people and I'm getting emotional.

48
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,360
Sorry.

49
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,199
Oh, I didn't see this coming.

50
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:48,600
I absolutely didn't see this coming.

51
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,600
Oh,

52
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:56,560
my sister visited Japan and um she told

53
00:04:53,520 --> 00:05:00,560
me, "Geu, when you leave, you will cry

54
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:05,120
because the Japanese people are so

55
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:11,199
gentle and kind and wonderful

56
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:14,880
and um I've been so so overwhelmed with

57
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:17,120
love demonstr I'm crying. Sorry, you

58
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:20,639
didn't see that coming.

59
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:24,240
Demonstrations of love and of

60
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:27,759
love. It's it's

61
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:30,240
it was unbelievable. And the gifts I'm

62
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:32,639
wearing here um

63
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,720
a necklace uh that was offered to me

64
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:37,680
with pearls

65
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:40,800

66
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:45,360
the the father uh passed in the other

67
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:47,440
realm uh very short shortly before the

68

conference and he had made this this

69
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:53,600
necklace and they offered it to me. I've

70
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:57,360

00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,919
from the bottom of my heart.

75
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:13,360
Japan is awakening and Mouseno planted

76
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:16,360
the seed of awakening.

77
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,360
Um,

78
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:22,240
she's doing a great job and she's a very

79
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:25,560
brave woman. She's the the dy and the

80
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,560
son of Japan.

81
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:32,240
Sorry for this emotional start.

82
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:36,880
Um, it's been an emotional roller

83
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:39,840
coaster recently. So, um,

84
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:42,400
that's it, you know. Here we go. I'm

85
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:44,560
human.

86
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:47,919
Um,

87
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:50,880
why is this um

88
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:52,800
um Alex in LA, your your comment is

89
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:55,120
showing up. I don't know what's going

90
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:58,080
on.

91
00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:02,880
I don't know. Uh I'm going to try to uh

92
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:09,319
hide message on stage. Okay. So,

93
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:09,319
the nature of soul and consciousness um

94
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:16,960
love

95
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:20,080
you know why I'm crying because I'm

96
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:22,639
experiencing love and um remember the

97
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:25,360
frequency of love of these people and

98
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:28,400
love is a frequency in fact it's a

99
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:31,680
creative frequency that when it passes

100
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:34,880
through a human heart it is experienced

101
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:38,400
as love.

102
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:43,120
Well, that's it. The heart

103
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:46,120
and the love of creator.

104
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,120
Um,

105
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:54,560
this is the essence of creation. Now

106
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:56,160
we need to have a little bit of a

107
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,160
journey through the universe, the

108
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:01,039
multiverse,

109
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:03,520
the origins.

110
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:07,240
So I

111
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,240
let me do this

112
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,400
now.

113
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:14,759
Origins.

114
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,160
The origins of consciousness.

115
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:25,479
Try to do this. Well,

116
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:37,039
the universe as we imagine is not

117
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:40,479
something that is

118
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:44,240
expanding infinitely. It is a bubble.

119
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:46,160
The bubble is of course expanding

120
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:51,720
but

121
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:51,720
in a spherical way. In a spherical way.

122
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:57,200
Visualize.

123
00:08:54,240 --> 00:09:00,160
Excuse me. The emotion is still there. I

124
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:02,640
need to find my words. Visualize the

125
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:06,320
flower of life. This beautiful flower of

126
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:07,839
life. This symbol that has been given to

127
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,839
humanity

128
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,839
by

129
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,519
extraterrestrials who came a long time

130
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:18,720
ago.

131
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:21,120
This flower of life was the key that

132
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:23,839
would help humans to understand the

133
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:26,720
nature of the universe. Now how what is

134
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:29,440
the universe? How does it work? What is

135
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:31,600
source creator? Where it is? Where we

136
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:35,720
are going? Everything is contained in

137
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,720
the flower of life pattern.

138
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:42,880
I prefer to see the charts than this

139
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:46,240
titles now. It's better.

140
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:48,880
The flower of life because it is the key

141
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:52,000
of the universe, the key of the

142
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:54,640
understanding of creation.

143
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:58,720
The flower of life. This pattern we can

144
00:09:54,640 --> 00:10:01,200
find in all the ancient temples preflood

145
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:03,360
I would say.

146
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:06,240
has been

147
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:09,200
um they try to hijack it. They try to

148
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:12,160
tell you that is a daisy of death or

149
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:16,800
just to turn away from it because it

150
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:19,360
contains the the answers to everything.

151
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:22,800
Look at it. This beautiful round pattern

152
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:26,000
of the flower of life,

153
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:27,680
all the circles,

154
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,519
it's

155
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:34,959
three-dimensional. It's bubbles. Okay.

156
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:37,839
And all these bubbles are intersecting

157
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:40,640
with each other.

158
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:43,519
Okay. Visualize a flower of life in

159
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:46,399
volume. Not flat, not a dis, but a

160
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:50,200
sphere. And all the circles are bubbles.

161
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:50,200
And it is expanding

162
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:56,399
in the center.

163
00:10:53,440 --> 00:11:00,079
It goes to the infinite infinitisimal

164
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:01,680
small and in the outer it goes in the

165
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:05,680
infinitisimal

166
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:08,480
big and it comes from the center and the

167
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:12,240
bubbles grow grow expand expand and as

168
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:15,440
they expand they move to the edge of the

169
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:18,800
not the edge but outwards of this big

170
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:21,360
sphere and they create more and more

171
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:23,360
bubbles come from the center creation of

172
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:26,959
universes and it goes

173
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:31,320
goes and it expands. Each bubble is a

174
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:31,320
dimensional universe.

175
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,519
One dimension per universe.

176
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:44,880
The densities are not dimensions. The

177
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:46,720
densities there's a confusion for those

178
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,959
who haven't followed all the

179
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:51,680
explanations I've been given through my

180
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:54,959
my my videos and and books. The

181
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:58,800
densities are

182
00:11:54,959 --> 00:12:02,000
a scale of vibration of matter in one

183
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:04,560
dimension one universe. You have

184
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,920
different scales of density who which

185
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:10,720
are the different levels of different

186
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:14,040
speeds of vibration of matter. It is

187
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,040
like octaves.

188
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:21,360
You imagine each universe is a keyboard

189
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:24,160
and you have an octave and each note is

190
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:26,240
a different frequency.

191
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:29,200
Frequency is a rate of vibration between

192
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:31,600
particles. That's why we cannot see the

193
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:34,560
lower frequency. We cannot see the

194
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:38,760
higher frequency but every frequency is

195
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:38,760
solid when you are in it.

196
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:46,000
after the ninth or the eighth frequency

197
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:48,880
uh density level.

198
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,880
It depends on the species but it starts

199
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:52,959
to be noncorporal

200
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:55,760
but still

201
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:57,760
tangible.

202
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:04,360
This is what the the multiverse the

203
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:04,360
universe is. This is what creation is.

204
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:12,800
You know, I haven't prepared graphics

205
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:15,600
and drawings or beautiful illustrations

206
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:19,440
for a reason. Because I want to

207
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:22,720
encourage you to visualize,

208
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:24,240
not be distracted by nice pictures, but

209
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,720
visualize.

210
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,959
May my words

211
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:32,399
help you create

212
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:35,360
the illustrations in your head of what I

213
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:38,800
am bringing to you. And this is the the

214
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:41,680
best way to memorize

215
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:46,000
to put images

216
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:48,480
on a knowledge that you receive.

217
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:52,760
Better than writing notes.

218
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,760
You can always watch this again.

219
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:57,839
Where is the source creator in all of

220
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,360
this in this universe?

221
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:01,920
Well,

222
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:05,040
it is

223
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:07,440
not really at the center. It is

224
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:10,240
everywhere.

225
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:12,959
A source is omnipresent.

226
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:16,079
As much as time is not linear when it's

227
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:19,440
not bind to gravity.

228
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:23,519
Space, it's the same.

229
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:27,600
Oh, now you going to hate me. No, not

230
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:30,000
space. Now we still had difficulty to

231
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:33,120
figure out time.

232
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:37,040
Non space now. Oh no.

233
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:39,360
Yes. Space is non

234
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:43,079
linear.

235
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:43,079
How to put it better?

236
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:49,120
Space is I would say globular.

237
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:52,079
I would say that like time. It's a

238
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:54,959
globe. It's a sphere. spherical and

239
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:57,360
expandable at the same time. A sphere is

240
00:14:54,959 --> 00:15:01,040
nonlinear because any point in the

241
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:03,519
sphere is on the edge of the sphere on

242
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:05,839
the the outside of the sphere is at

243
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:08,320
equal distance from the center. So

244
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:09,839
there's no linearity. But inside of the

245
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,320
sphere everything is moving in all

246
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:14,639
directions. There is no linearity

247
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:19,839
either.

248
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:22,000
So is time. So is space.

249
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:26,399
So,

250
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:29,360
I'm I'm I'm going to just pose it here

251
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:33,279
because I know you're all

252
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:35,680
but you know if

253
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:37,920
try to not listen to this with your

254
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:41,839
mind,

255
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:44,800
your logical mind. Try to listen to this

256
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:47,279
I would say with your heart with your

257
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,880
the heart that is here the pinal gland

258
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:51,279
because that's where you're connected to

259
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:56,720
source and to the greater knowledge of

260
00:15:51,279 --> 00:16:01,079
the universe. So try to remember

261
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:01,079
what these words

262
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:09,199
are triggering you as understanding even

263
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:12,160
the craziest ideas they may be right.

264
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:15,279
So imagine space

265
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:17,759
non-flat nonlinear

266
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:20,399
out of time

267
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:23,040
and time is out of space.

268
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:25,759
Space is out of time

269
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:29,320
but they are entangled

270
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:29,320
in their ways.

271
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:37,440
You will remember because that's where

272
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:40,959
you come from.

273
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:44,680
Now that you know it, you remember

274
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:44,680
everything will come.

275
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:52,920
Source tense is not

276
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,920
at a center.

277
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,920
It is everywhere.

278
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:06,559
I'll develop this later. But creation

279
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:11,880
contains the creator

280
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:11,880
as much as creator contains the creation

281
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:21,319
every particles of your being

282
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:28,240
I don't need I don't mean the physical

283
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:32,400
body the being that is inside

284
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,400
is a fractal of source creation

285
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:39,360
You are it and it is you.

286
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:42,480
You have a quantum entanglement of

287
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:46,160
consciousness between your consciousness

288
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:49,840
and source consciousness

289
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:52,240
because it is a fractal.

290
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:56,280
What source feels you feel. What you

291
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:56,280
feel she feels.

292
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:05,440
Now in your bodies that you borrow

293
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:08,880
and especially the bodies of the human

294
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:11,760
the human body is something very special

295
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:14,400
um that the grays have been trying to

296
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:19,280
hybridize to crack the codes but still

297
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:22,559
haven't uh yet um managed

298
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:26,400
these bodies contain a DNA.

299
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:28,480
Okay. Human DNA is vorticial

300
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:32,240
uh structure. That means that every

301
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:36,559
little micro vortices in your DNA

302
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:40,720
in your two strand DNA

303
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:42,480
is a vortex that connects you to source

304
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,799
creator

305
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:48,720
one

306
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:53,679
allows you to create two.

307
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:55,600
And these two elix alixes are an aerial.

308
00:18:53,679 --> 00:19:01,039
An aerial

309
00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:04,720
to connect to the universe.

310
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:09,039
This is very important.

311
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:11,520
When I say creator is you and you are

312
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:13,840
the creator.

313
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:17,039
This is what it means. You have the

314
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:19,360
power of source within these bodies.

315
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:23,120
That is why they are so special. Human

316
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:25,919
DNA is a currency in the universe. It is

317
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:28,559
very special.

318
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:30,960
All living beings in the universe are

319
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:33,120
children of source are created by source

320
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:36,480
and are a fractal consciousness of

321
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:39,520
source. Anything that is animated

322
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:42,000
and even the heart of the stars and of

323
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:46,080
the planets,

324
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:48,720
the planets who have a magnetic field.

325
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:51,440
That's a condition to power a

326
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:53,280
consciousness.

327
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:56,880
Everything is entangled to source

328
00:19:53,280 --> 00:20:00,240
consciousness is a fractile of it.

329
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:04,400
Hence as its creation is able to

330
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:07,200
manifest thoughts and feelings and

331
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:09,440
thoughts and feelings

332
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:11,919
create

333
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:15,120
how

334
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:18,080
thoughts and feelings emit a frequency.

335
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:22,480
emit feelings. Emit a frequency that are

336
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:26,000
going to tickle the web, the network of

337
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:29,440
the matrix of your reality, our reality,

338
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:35,200
the reality of this universe.

339
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:37,440
Emotion is a very very powerful tool.

340
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:41,280
Okay?

341
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:45,799
Emotion can make you

342
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:45,799
move mountains as we say.

343
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:54,000
Go f fight for and win a challenge.

344
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:57,120
Emotion is is everything

345
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:59,200
is the fuel.

346
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,720
Okay, that's emotion. That's the heart.

347
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:03,840
Then

348
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:06,640
you have the thoughts, the mind

349
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:09,039
and thoughts. What are thoughts?

350
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:11,440
thoughts first. It comes from an

351
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:14,080
intention from consciousness,

352
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:18,000
from spirit or consciousness. It's the

353
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:19,679
same thing. And this thought is going to

354
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,280
be

355
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:25,280
uh

356
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:29,360
how to say um manifested in the brain,

357
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:32,000
the biological human brain, your your

358
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:35,840
higher self. The higher self, what is

359
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:38,000
it? Higher frequency self. It's your

360
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:40,799
soul.

361
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:44,320
It's what inhabits this body. What

362
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:47,679
inhabits this third density bodies

363
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:51,679
actually is a higher density being.

364
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:54,400
That's a higher self. That's what it is.

365
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:56,000
It's you. It's you. It's a real you.

366
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:59,000
Okay.

367
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
So,

368
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:04,240
where did I want to go with that? Yes.

369
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:06,559
the the the higher self, you your

370
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:10,000
spirit, you as a spirit consciousness,

371
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:11,600
you think about something

372
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,600
because you are the engine, okay?

373
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:15,360
Thinking engine.

374
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:19,799
And

375
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:19,799
this thought is going to crystallize,

376
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:25,200
okay, enter by the pinal gland,

377
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:30,240
crystallize into the brain, and the

378
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:31,919
brain is going to um reverberate it back

379
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:36,080
as a thought.

380
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:42,760
And it the brain human biological brain

381
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:42,760
will send an electrical impulse signal

382
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:48,320
automatically

383
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:53,679
and this impulse signal okay it's a

384
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:57,200
carrier wave. So this carrier wave

385
00:22:53,679 --> 00:23:00,240
will carry the thought the intention

386
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:03,039
like a boat

387
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:05,360
and this carrier wave electrical impulse

388
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:09,120
carrier wave

389
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:11,679
or pump wave or scalar wave. It also be

390
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:15,200
assimilated to gravity waves. Let's call

391
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:19,039
it a scalar scalar wave. It's going to

392
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:22,640
tickle whoops to tickle the web of

393
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:24,720
reality, the network of this matrix

394
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:27,280
where you're in

395
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:30,720
and it is going to run through all the

396
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:33,280
networks as an electrical impulse. It's

397
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:36,799
a holographic electrical

398
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:41,440
sorry it's a holographic matrix network

399
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:45,520
web and the it's receptive to electrical

400
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:49,120
impulse signals. holograms

401
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:51,520
whatever science tells you in my science

402
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:54,000
when my science is science is is

403
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:56,080
universal but I mean in the science and

404
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,880
the technology I mean in the technology

405
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:00,880
that I'm using when I am with my pairs

406
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:03,600
upstairs

407
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:06,320
holograms

408
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:08,799
can be manipulated and directed by the

409
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:12,159
electromagnetic field of the human body

410
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:14,400
of the hand you have a holographic uh

411
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:16,320
screen. You're going to put your hand,

412
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:19,320
your fingers in it and you can move

413
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:19,320
stuff.

414
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:27,840
It's the same with the mat holographic

415
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:32,159
network of the matrix, okay? The

416
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:35,919
structure of the universe and

417
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:39,039
of course your body. But your thoughts,

418
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:41,600
your thoughts, it's way more powerful

419
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:44,480
than the touch of your fingers.

420
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:46,480
Yes. And it's going, this electrical

421
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:49,679
impulse,

422
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:53,039
the scalar wave is going to

423
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:54,880
hit it. It's all the web of of reality.

424
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:58,320
In fact, it's not a web on which you

425
00:24:54,880 --> 00:25:00,240
are. It's everything around you. It's

426
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:02,799
everything. It's all every object. It's

427
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:05,799
everything that that that's it's made of

428
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:05,799
it.

429
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:12,640
It's going to just go through it.

430
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:16,240
But if it carries an intention and if

431
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:20,240
the intention or the thoughts is doubled

432
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:23,679
by emotion that is going to really

433
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:26,720
go into it and imprint it. That's why

434
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:30,799
you always need to be positive

435
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:34,720
and loving and be in a higher frequency.

436
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:37,760
The deep state is sending at you fear

437
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:40,080
porn. the fear that you you you radiate

438
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:43,360
fear and you watch the the catastrophic

439
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:46,240
movie disaster movies on Netflix etc.

440
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:50,720
and you are creating by your thought

441
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:53,360
response the reality they want

442
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:57,200
not the one you want.

443
00:25:53,360 --> 00:26:00,880
Once you've understood that,

444
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:04,960
oh yes, you stop playing their games and

445
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:07,919
you start to create your own reality.

446
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:10,960
How to create

447
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:13,440
a viable

448
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:16,640
intention or thought that is going to

449
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:18,559
really make a change around you in the

450
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:22,400
the matrix.

451
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:26,000
Well, this matrix is holographic, okay?

452
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:30,279
And receptive to uh electromagnetic uh

453
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,279
impulse or scalar waves.

454
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:34,320
So, you need to imprint a hologram. You

455
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,919
need to speak the same language, the

456
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:38,240
same mathematical language as the

457
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:40,720
matrix. Okay?

458
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:42,880
You're going to speak hologram.

459
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:45,520
You're going to speak holographic. How

460
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:49,679
do you speak holographic?

461
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:52,720
With your visualization, imagination.

462
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:56,080
Imagination. We are told as children at

463
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:59,039
school, it's bad. It's

464
00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:01,520
no, it's fantasy

465
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:03,039
because imagination is your power.

466
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:06,320
Imagination

467
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:09,279
is the intention you put. So how do you

468
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:11,600
create a holographic tool that you are

469
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:13,120
going to holographic language? Well,

470
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:16,559
with your imagination, your

471
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:18,400
visualization, you create inside of your

472
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:21,120
mind

473
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:23,279
what you want to be in the world. And

474
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:25,840
this thing you're going to imagine it

475
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:27,760
created as a hologram.

476
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:33,200
meaning

477
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:37,120
not as a image or wish

478
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:38,880
as something that you convince yourself.

479
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:45,000
It's very important you convince

480
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:45,000
yourself it is real. It exists already.

481
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:53,760
For instance, you have a barren land.

482
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:58,080
You want a tree, but you don't have

483
00:27:53,760 --> 00:28:01,120
seeds. Okay,

484
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:03,919
you are going to look at this land

485
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:07,360
in your head. You imagine this land with

486
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:09,840
a tree on it growing. Okay, that's not

487
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:14,640
enough.

488
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:18,320
This tree you are going to visualize it

489
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:23,440
on all direction possible. All the

490
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:26,960
roots, all the leaves, you create it

491
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:31,000
from the front, behind, the sides, the

492
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:31,000
top, all directions.

493
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:36,799
And you visualize it that it is here.

494
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:39,679
It's in volume in your head. Okay? You

495
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:42,399
open your your eyes and you superimpose

496
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:45,360
this vision on the reality that is for

497
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:48,559
the moment, the barren land.

498
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:51,919
Can I show you? Very shortly the wind

499
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:55,919
will bring a seed that will germinate

500
00:28:51,919 --> 00:29:00,320
and there will be a tree growing there.

501
00:28:55,919 --> 00:29:02,559
That is how you change reality.

502
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:04,880
And it works for

503
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:09,200
bigger scale

504
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:10,880
projects such as

505
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:12,240
um

506
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:15,240
however you want to see your

507
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:15,240
environment.

508
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:23,440
the human condition, work condition,

509
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:25,760
free energy, whatever, health

510
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:28,399
where everything you want, you can make

511
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:30,480
it. So this is the power of

512
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:32,799
consciousness.

513
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:36,559
This is why source

514
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:38,080
is within us. It is everywhere in our

515
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:41,039
cells.

516
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:44,559
It is connected to everywhere in our

517
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:47,520
body. It is

518
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:50,399
it is it it is the universe is the

519
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:52,799
creator. The creator is the universe.

520
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:56,640
When I

521
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:58,960
was shown, when I saw

522
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:02,000
the shape and the body of the universe

523
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:04,799
of creator

524
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,960
on the Nibiru ship when I went to visit

525
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:09,279
the mad kahal

526
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:12,000
for the second time I did a webinar on

527
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:14,799
that.

528
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:17,440
I wanted to see the universe

529
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:19,600
and I saw this bubble universe. I saw it

530
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:23,360
and suddenly

531
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:28,760
I sensed it. It was alive. It was

532
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:28,760
animated with one global consciousness.

533
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:35,039
A universal consciousness that was it.

534
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:39,600
And a universe was its body. And this

535
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:42,480
universal consciousness was source.

536
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:48,080
It was the creator. And the the the

537
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:48,080
creation is the body of the creator.

538
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:56,240
It's like creator is a soul and that's

539
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:59,279
the most huge scale of things.

540
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:01,200
This creator is the origin. It has it

541
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:05,960
was never born and it will never die

542
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:05,960
because it is in universal time.

543
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:14,200
I know you remember. I know many of you

544
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:14,200
who are listening to this remember.

545
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:20,320
You start to remember.

546
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:22,799
Right.

547
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:25,760
Right.

548
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:29,120
Allow the images to come. Allow the

549
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:31,840
feeling. And do not doubt of yourself

550
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:34,559
because you know these things too. You

551
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:37,559
knew them at one point. It's still

552
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:37,559
there.

553
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:47,399
So what is the journey of a soul?

554
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:47,399
This is how the universe is.

555
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:58,919
Now, how a soul is born

556
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:58,919
is detached from source.

557
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:07,080
Source creator constantly fractal

558
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:07,080
itself.

559
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:14,080
I like to say herself but itself it's

560
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:16,559
neutral and it contains the both talk

561
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:20,240
about that another time. So you have a

562
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:22,960
soul that is fractal from source. What

563
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:27,440
does it mean? Imagine source even if it

564
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:29,519
is not like a a big ball of energy. It's

565
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:32,159
it's not like this but that the process

566
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:36,960
is is more understandable like this.

567
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:39,760
Okay. It's going to send a spark,

568
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:42,240
an offshoot that's going to leave it and

569
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:44,799
fly to somewhere like a little

570
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:46,960
spermatzoid shape, but it's

571
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:50,960
consciousness. It looks like etheric

572
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:53,919
light, like um a firefly

573
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:58,159
going to go through the universe, rocket

574
00:32:53,919 --> 00:33:01,840
through a tunnel that is a pathway that

575
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:04,000
is traced be between the stars

576
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:06,480
like

577
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,720
motorways, not motorways, but highways.

578
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:12,559
I mean, sorry, highways between the

579
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:14,080
stars and it's going to reach a

580
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:18,000
destination

581
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:21,440
chosen by source. It's never random.

582
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:23,919
Source never

583
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:27,200
shots

584
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:30,640
pieces of itself in the void like good

585
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:35,120
luck, find a planet, good luck. No, it's

586
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:38,720
not working like this. Everything is

587
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:41,200
pointed at something. There's

588
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:43,279
a world somewhere

589
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:45,840
that is going to be the home world that

590
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:52,559
is already the home world of this little

591
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:55,519
offshoot even before it was fractiled.

592
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:59,679
Remember time is not linear.

593
00:33:55,519 --> 00:34:06,240
Keep that in mind. Try not to put this

594
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:09,040
in a scale of linear time. Okay?

595
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:12,159
Think everything at the same time.

596
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:14,240
When source shots its fractal of

597
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:16,960
consciousness, there's already a world

598
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:21,359
and the path between the stars has the

599
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:23,760
highway has been has been already

600
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:27,079
um created

601
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:27,079
by source.

602
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:33,760
Now

603
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:38,399
this fractal is going to be entangled to

604
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:41,960
this world and it's this little

605
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:41,960
etheric spermatus.

606
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:46,879
See it like this. Um it's nice to

607
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:49,760
visualize things like this. When it's

608
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:52,159
funny you remember better.

609
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:58,160
It's going to be entangled to this

610
00:34:52,159 --> 00:35:00,480
planet and this planet requires to have

611
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:06,000
an electromagnetic field that is going

612
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:09,280
to be able to uh sustain life. Okay. No

613
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:12,880
electromagnetic field uh life cannot

614
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:16,680
really develop. It's it's difficult

615
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:16,680
even not happening.

616
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:20,880
And

617
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:23,920
because there's this electromagnetic

618
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:27,280
field, the planet

619
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:31,079
is going to also get a fractal of source

620
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:31,079
to develop a consciousness.

621
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:35,839
Electromagnetic fields means there's a

622
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:40,400
consciousness there.

623
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:43,680
It's conscious. It is sentient.

624
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:47,200
planets, stars, and everything alive

625
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:52,000
that has a electromagnetic field.

626
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:55,440
So, there's going to be etheric layers

627
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:57,599
around this planet. Etheric layers. What

628
00:35:55,440 --> 00:36:01,520
is it? It's

629
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:03,839
um like envelopes, layers around the

630
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:06,640
sphere of the planet that are on in

631
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:08,560
different densities that it's the realm

632
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:11,280
of the soul. It's not realms densities

633
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:12,880
of incarnation. It's densities

634
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:15,599
um

635
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:19,119
of

636
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:21,599
existence when you're not incarnated.

637
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:23,760
Okay.

638
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:26,800
Um

639
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:31,040
everything is good in the in the the

640
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:34,920
chat. Light sound frozen screen. No,

641
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:34,920
it's okay. Okay.

642
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:42,800
Yes. Thank you, Joanna.

643
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:44,640
Joanna, I love you. Your Tat Tatiana.

644
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:46,320
Oh, I see all the names now. Susie.

645
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:48,000
Okay, I'm not going to be distracted.

646
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:51,560
All the beautiful people that I love,

647
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,560
who I love. Okay.

648
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:57,960
You arrive on this world

649
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:05,599
as a shoot of consciousness. Then you

650
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:08,480
are going to anchor there. It's your it

651
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:11,040
will be your home forever.

652
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:14,079
Even when you will leave it, it will rem

653
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:17,599
be remembered as your home. Because this

654
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:21,920
is where you are going to develop as a

655
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:24,720
consciousness and grow going through the

656
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:28,400
consciousness of a rock to consciousness

657
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:31,520
of a cell, of a vegetital,

658
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:34,800
a liquid, a vegetital, and then tiny

659
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:37,599
animals until more complex organisms.

660
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:41,440
complex, complex, complex until you

661
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:43,760
reach the higher stage of evolution on

662
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:47,520
that world. That may be human, that may

663
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:50,240
be anything else. the and once you have

664
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:51,760
reached the the highest stage of

665
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:54,320
consciousness on that planet, you've

666
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:57,200
you've achieved

667
00:37:54,320 --> 00:38:00,480
one great cycle of incarnation because

668
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:02,640
you have micro cycles of incarnation and

669
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:06,320
then you have that which are contained

670
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:08,560
in wider circles of incarnation and

671
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:13,599
these wider circles are also contained

672
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:15,280
in wider circles and it's going like

673
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:19,119
this.

674
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:21,440
So c little circle as stone

675
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:24,720
consciousness as rock consciousness.

676
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:27,040
Little circle another little circle as

677
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:29,599
incarnations in the vegetital realm.

678
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:32,400
Another circle in the incarnation of

679
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:36,079
small animal insect or whatever. And and

680
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:38,720
all these little circles that are once

681
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:40,960
you complete it you pass you up into the

682
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:43,599
other one. Means your consciousness is

683
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:46,880
going to be able to develop more in a

684
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:51,040
plant than in a rock for instance. All

685
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:52,640
these little circles of cycles of

686
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:56,480
incarnations

687
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:58,720
in each different levels

688
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:01,280
they are contained in a wider circle

689
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:03,599
which is the planetary cycle of

690
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:05,920
reincarnation. Once you've achieved the

691
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:09,680
highest level it's like in video games.

692
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:12,240
Okay. you've completed your your your

693
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:14,480
your game.

694
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:17,839
Um,

695
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:21,280
and then you're allowed

696
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:24,640
to pass in the upper level, which is you

697
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:27,920
now able to incarnate

698
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:32,240
outside of your planet on another planet

699
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:35,359
that you choose. How cool is that? And

700
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:36,640
you can become a star seed.

701
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:39,200
First, you need to complete all the

702
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:40,880
levels on your planet.

703
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:43,839
Um,

704
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:46,960
that's the journey of a soul. That's the

705
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:49,440
journey of a soul.

706
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:52,240
Well,

707
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:54,240
once you

708
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:56,320
completed the greater circles of

709
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:58,000
incarnation, the universal circles of

710
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:59,359
incarnation,

711
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:03,079
it's going to take time. You're going to

712
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:03,079
go through all the densities

713
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:12,320
until source. And when our this

714
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:16,400
dimension universe where we are has 12

715
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:18,720
levels of densities of matter and the

716
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:21,520
13th is source.

717
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:24,480
When you reach the 12,

718
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:27,480
you're ready.

719
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:27,480
Remember

720
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:34,960
you are source and it is you

721
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:40,920
as a consciousness

722
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:40,920
also at first of course

723
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:47,880
you will go back to source.

724
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:57,680
When I first remembered this that one

725
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:59,680
day I will remerge again with source

726
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:01,200
I was upset.

727
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:04,319
What

728
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:07,680
all that I have loved and experienced

729
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:09,760
and all my memories of an existence

730
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:14,160
throughout so many incarnations it's

731
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:17,359
going to dissolve into the the big thing

732
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:20,240
and I'm not going to be me anymore.

733
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:23,280
That's what I thought first.

734
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:26,400
that because I was thinking

735
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:30,520
like you many of you may be thinking as

736
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:30,520
an individuated consciousness

737
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:38,000
which is a temporary stage in our

738
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:40,240
journey in the journey of source through

739
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,560
us.

740
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:45,440
We are source experiencing

741
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:48,000
in other words.

742
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:49,839
But when you reach the higher levels of

743
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:52,880
density,

744
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:55,520
you you have a different set of mind.

745
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:59,119
You do not think with the ego and with

746
00:41:55,520 --> 00:42:03,359
the the individuality. You think more

747
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:05,680
and more as the universe,

748
00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:08,400
as source.

749
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:11,200
And when you go back to source, you

750
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:15,359
emerge into it,

751
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:17,680
you bring back to the origin

752
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:21,760
everything that you have learned,

753
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:25,200
everything that you have experienced

754
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:28,960
and source will grow

755
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:33,440
through your experience.

756
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:36,800
Source grows and learns through us

757
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:36,800
in these ways.

758
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:43,079
This is the journey of the soul.

759
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:50,119
Now, um

760
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:57,119
I'm going to tell you about what um the

761
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:58,400
consciousness types.

762
00:42:57,119 --> 00:43:01,200
Yes, the different types of

763
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:04,000
consciousness.

764
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:08,720
So um

765
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:11,520
you have you have uh you know different

766
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:14,960
different species in the universe.

767
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:16,720
So you I'll go through this later but uh

768
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:19,720
let's take the human species for

769
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:19,720
instance.

770
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:26,640
So we have

771
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:29,119
when we are going to arrive on the

772
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:32,079
planet

773
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:35,359
we are going to associate with other

774
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:37,920
souls. Usually humans do that. Uh there

775
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:41,119
are many ETSs who do not do that who do

776
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:45,520
not have soul clusters or soul families.

777
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:48,240
Okay. Sometimes source sends a a bunch

778
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:50,640
often often source does that a bunch of

779
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:53,040
shots that they are entangled to each

780
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:55,280
other and throughout the whole cycles

781
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:56,880
they are going to travel together and

782
00:43:55,280 --> 00:44:00,000
reincarnate

783
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:02,560
uh not far from each other and still

784
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:05,520
remember the entanglement.

785
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:09,680
this or when you arrive on the planet

786
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:13,040
you're going to entangle with other

787
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:16,400
little light fireflies of consciousness

788
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:19,200
and this is going to become your soul

789
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:21,920
family. Your soul cluster. A soul

790
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:27,920
cluster or soul family

791
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:31,920
um is different from a planetary

792
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:34,960
family type of race consciousness. Okay.

793
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:39,440
your soul family or your soul cluster.

794
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:42,720
It's not the whole of a planet. Okay?

795
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:44,720
It's a tiny group.

796
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:50,160
Tiny group, okay, to which you are

797
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:52,160
entangled. Then um

798
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:55,280
humans are an individuated

799
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:59,359
consciousness. So, okay,

800
00:44:55,280 --> 00:45:01,520
you have five types of uh consciousness.

801
00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:04,480
I'm going to go through them all but

802
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:07,680
first I'm going to uh tell you you have

803
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:10,319
the the individuated consciousness

804
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:13,520
humans you

805
00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:17,119
individuated consciousness collective

806
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:18,960
such as the altians the individuated uh

807
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:22,560
consciousness

808
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:26,880
uh planetary collective

809
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:26,880
the microhives and the hives

810
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:34,560
individuated consciousness, individuated

811
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:37,680
collective consciousness, individuated

812
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:40,319
planetary consciousness, microhives and

813
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:43,200
hives.

814
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:47,200
And this is not a scale of evolution at

815
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:50,480
all at all. It's different types that

816
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:52,720
coexist at the same times regarding the

817
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:56,839
species.

818
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:56,839
very important the species.

819
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:03,760
So individuated

820
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:06,960
consciousness individuated consciousness

821
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:10,319
this is humans that means that means

822
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:13,839
that we think for ourselves

823
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:16,319
we are independent thinkers

824
00:46:13,839 --> 00:46:19,960
we are linked with nothing. Okay, that's

825
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:19,960
a basic human

826
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:28,240
individuated. Second type, individuated

827
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:30,720
collective consciousness.

828
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:32,319
I named the alians

829
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:35,440
because they are like this. It's a good

830
00:46:32,319 --> 00:46:36,880
example. You are still an individuated.

831
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:40,560
That means you think for yourself.

832
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:42,960
You're independent on of thought, but

833
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:47,000
you are interfaced

834
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:47,000
with a collective,

835
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:52,079
a race,

836
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:55,079
a species.

837
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:55,079
Okay?

838
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:01,280
When

839
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:04,640
you are on your home world, you are

840
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:07,280
interfaced with

841
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:10,520
the other members of your species on the

842
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:10,520
whole planet.

843
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:15,599
That means you're not going to think

844
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:19,839
like it same like each other. That's the

845
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:21,520
hive. It's not same. But you're going to

846
00:47:19,839 --> 00:47:23,119
share

847
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:25,440
awareness,

848
00:47:23,119 --> 00:47:27,599
some feelings when you're close to some

849
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:31,119
of them.

850
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:35,839
Um, but also your heartbeats will have

851
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:38,000
tendency in calm mode to um in to tune

852
00:47:35,839 --> 00:47:41,280
with everyone.

853
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:43,359
You can be frightened or go for run a

854
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:44,800
sprint. The heartbeat is going to go

855
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:47,839
faster. But when it comes back to

856
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:51,040
normal, it will tune with all the other

857
00:47:47,839 --> 00:47:53,359
heartbeats. That's for instance. And you

858
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:56,560
have an easiness to communicate

859
00:47:53,359 --> 00:48:00,079
telepathically with anyone else from

860
00:47:56,560 --> 00:48:03,119
your race. When you leave the planet for

861
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:05,599
a trip in space, you will recreate your

862
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:08,400
micro individuated consciousness

863
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:14,200
collective in the ship with the other

864
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:14,200
members of the ship. and how it goes.

865
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:21,200
Third type, individuated consciousness,

866
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:24,559
planetary

867
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:26,720
individuated planetary consciousness.

868
00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:28,960
Same thing as the one before, but

869
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:31,359
instead of being interfaced, still

870
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:33,920
individuated your own thing, thoughts,

871
00:48:31,359 --> 00:48:37,680
your individual, but instead of being

872
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:41,040
connected to a race, it's connected to a

873
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:43,440
planet and every living thing on it. And

874
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:48,160
that's the movie Avatar for those who

875
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:51,119
saw it. You are

876
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:53,599
independent of thoughts,

877
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:55,359
but you are in tune. You can tune in

878
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:58,079
with the whole planet and all the

879
00:48:55,359 --> 00:49:01,040
animals. You can converse telepathically

880
00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:03,760
with all the animals with the wind, with

881
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:05,359
the the flowers, with the trees, with

882
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:07,440
everything.

883
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:10,319
That's an individuated

884
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:14,319
planetary consciousness.

885
00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:17,440
My favorite. Then you have type four, a

886
00:49:14,319 --> 00:49:20,400
microhives. The microhives, it's like

887
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:23,119
it's a soul cluster. Let's go back to

888
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:28,880
soul clusters.

889
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:31,280
um who are uh very much uh dependent on

890
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:33,359
each other.

891
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:36,880
They

892
00:49:33,359 --> 00:49:39,680
still they're half individuated because

893
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:44,319
they feed each other so much. So good

894
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:46,559
example is the Jmen the who are part of

895
00:49:44,319 --> 00:49:50,240
the cedars.

896
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:53,119
they they have a central

897
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:55,200
um consciousness.

898
00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:58,800
Okay.

899
00:49:55,200 --> 00:50:00,559
That fractals itself into different

900
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:02,480
bodies

901
00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:05,200
and everybody

902
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:07,200
every each of the bodies will be

903
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:11,839
interfaced with a central consciousness

904
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:16,640
which is usually living within a star.

905
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:19,440
Not always but that's very often.

906
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:22,079
You will share thoughts. One is sick,

907
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:24,480
the others are sick. One is happy, the

908
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:26,000
others are happy. Things like this, you

909
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:28,559
know, you feed each other. It's like

910
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:32,200
plants.

911
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:32,200
So that's a microhive.

912
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:36,559
We don't call the central consciousness

913
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:39,559
a queen. We call it a central

914
00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:39,559
consciousness.

915
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:47,920
Then you have type five, the hives.

916
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:51,359
So the hives it's uh you have within the

917
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:54,800
hive a classification in three uh

918
00:50:51,359 --> 00:50:56,400
different parts three different hives.

919
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:58,000
Okay.

920
00:50:56,400 --> 00:51:03,520
Um

921
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:07,640
type one type hive type one

922
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:07,640
uh it's a single species

923
00:51:08,319 --> 00:51:14,079
which is interfaced with their own

924
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:18,400
biological queen.

925
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:20,800
Take for instance the ants

926
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:23,760
particular species interface with a

927
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:26,800
biological queen of theirs. They all

928
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:31,119
connected by the mind. The consciousness

929
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:36,160
of the queen is is fractal into all the

930
00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:38,720
other beings and she commands them. It's

931
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:41,359
not individuated anymore. A hive is not

932
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:43,680
an individuated consciousness. Um the

933
00:51:41,359 --> 00:51:47,200
grays are the most of the gray aliens

934
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:49,839
are um high consciousness. Not the soypi

935
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:52,640
for instance but most of them are. So

936
00:51:49,839 --> 00:51:57,280
they can think by by themselves but the

937
00:51:52,640 --> 00:52:00,079
minimum vital like I want to eat. I'm

938
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:01,760
hungry. Uh I'm upset. I'm scared. Oh I

939
00:52:00,079 --> 00:52:04,960
want to go there because I need to do

940
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:08,480
this. That's it. But philosophical

941
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:12,000
thoughts no they can't. It's the Borgs.

942
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:15,680
Remember the Borgs in Star Trek? Um,

943
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:17,680
that's a type one uh hive where they

944
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:20,800
have a queen and the queen sends signal

945
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:24,319
to everyone in the hive and everyone

946
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:27,839
hears everyone else's thoughts. That's a

947
00:52:24,319 --> 00:52:33,040
type one hive.

948
00:52:27,839 --> 00:52:35,839
Type two hive. Now it's a single species

949
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:38,319
uh still uh which is that time

950
00:52:35,839 --> 00:52:42,079
interfaced not with a biological queen

951
00:52:38,319 --> 00:52:44,319
of theirs but with the planetary

952
00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:49,520
consciousness

953
00:52:44,319 --> 00:52:53,520
the planetary soul or queen. So that is

954
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:57,760
rare that is not common. The type one is

955
00:52:53,520 --> 00:53:00,640
extremely common. The neighbor type one

956
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:04,800
a type this type two they they don't

957
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:08,480
have a proper biological queen. They are

958
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:11,520
entangled to the planetary. So you

959
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:13,680
remember when the neu were dismantled uh

960
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:18,400
the council of anam has been working

961
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:20,079
very hard to recompose the planetary

962
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:23,760
hives.

963
00:53:20,079 --> 00:53:25,359
Remember that. Yes, for those who follow

964
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:31,359
SNN,

965
00:53:25,359 --> 00:53:34,880
um it means that a species like grays,

966
00:53:31,359 --> 00:53:38,559
they are hive consciousness built.

967
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:40,079
That's their nature. So

968
00:53:38,559 --> 00:53:43,440
what happened with the destruction of

969
00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:45,680
the nebu superhive? They were all

970
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:48,480
enslaved and entangled to the the super

971
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:53,119
queen in the Orion Nebula. She's been

972
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:55,599
destroyed. Bye-bye. been bin and then

973
00:53:53,119 --> 00:53:58,480
they were they had a moment where they

974
00:53:55,599 --> 00:54:00,880
were disconnected. They were like, "Wow,

975
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:03,280
I'm lost. What's going on?" But

976
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:06,240
naturally,

977
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:08,640
suddenly when the signal of the Nebu

978
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:12,559
superhive queen that has enslaved all

979
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:16,160
the other hives stopped,

980
00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:20,079
another signal that is embedded in their

981
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:22,640
genes, in their consciousness

982
00:54:20,079 --> 00:54:24,400
started to be heard again in their their

983
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:27,440
their being, their physiomy, their

984
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:29,680
biology, their planetary

985
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:31,440
mother hive.

986
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:35,280
So they were all brought back on their

987
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:40,079
home worlds, helped and led there to

988
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:41,599
reconnect to their planetary soul.

989
00:54:40,079 --> 00:54:43,760
Okay.

990
00:54:41,599 --> 00:54:46,000
So

991
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:48,400
then once they were reconnect with their

992
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:51,040
planetary hive, they could reconnect

993
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:54,480
among themselves and rebuild their

994
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:57,200
proper hive, which is a very natural and

995
00:54:54,480 --> 00:55:02,079
organic way.

996
00:54:57,200 --> 00:55:06,559
the type three. The type three it's um

997
00:55:02,079 --> 00:55:08,480
so it's uh a little bit different.

998
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:12,559
It's not a species anymore interface,

999
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:14,960
but it's called a global planetary

1000
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:19,520
hive consciousness. Global planetary

1001
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:22,240
that means every living sentient thing

1002
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:24,720
on one planet

1003
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:26,640
is entangled to each other by high

1004
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:28,880
consciousness.

1005
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:32,079
Not one species anymore. The whole

1006
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:35,119
planet. Okay.

1007
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:37,440
All life forms on the planet.

1008
00:55:35,119 --> 00:55:41,119
So,

1009
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:43,359
do we go again over all all of this?

1010
00:55:41,119 --> 00:55:47,240
Yeah.

1011
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:47,240
Individuated consciousness,

1012
00:55:47,359 --> 00:55:52,280
individuated collective consciousness,

1013
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:59,559
individuated planetary consciousness,

1014
00:55:56,559 --> 00:55:59,559
microhive

1015
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:07,680
hives with type one, a single species

1016
00:56:05,599 --> 00:56:11,680
interfaced with their own biological

1017
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:13,680
queen. Type two, still a single species

1018
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:18,079
but interface with a planetary

1019
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:20,720
consciousness. And type three a global

1020
00:56:18,079 --> 00:56:22,400
planetary hive interface with

1021
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:23,839
everything. And the the center of the

1022
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:26,559
hive is of course the heart of the

1023
00:56:23,839 --> 00:56:28,960
planet.

1024
00:56:26,559 --> 00:56:33,680
So

1025
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:36,319
bit complex but um

1026
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:38,640
take your time. But you know what I'm

1027
00:56:36,319 --> 00:56:40,319
telling you is there are things you can

1028
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:42,319
remember.

1029
00:56:40,319 --> 00:56:47,440
Maybe not all of you knew these things

1030
00:56:42,319 --> 00:56:51,240
before, but many of you, I'm sure,

1031
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:51,240
will remember this.

1032
00:56:54,799 --> 00:57:02,359
The the creation is the creator. When we

1033
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:02,359
say that

1034
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:08,640
it's because we have the power to

1035
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:11,280
cocreate with source

1036
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:13,680
by the power of our consciousness.

1037
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:16,400
When you change the world, when you

1038
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:19,119
change yourself, I mean

1039
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:22,640
you you go for a healing session for

1040
00:57:19,119 --> 00:57:26,960
instance, you change

1041
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:30,960
you see the world differently. You see

1042
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:35,359
the world differently and you know what

1043
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:38,400
the world around you is going to change.

1044
00:57:35,359 --> 00:57:41,280
How many of you have uh done a therapy

1045
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:45,599
session whatever the the the technique

1046
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:49,040
went home and behave differently,

1047
00:57:45,599 --> 00:57:51,280
thought differently and suddenly start

1048
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:52,880
to influence everyone around you to

1049
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:57,760
change

1050
00:57:52,880 --> 00:58:00,000
unexpectedly and even things.

1051
00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:02,400
That's the best proof

1052
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:04,160
that we manifest our reality with our

1053
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:07,280
thoughts.

1054
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:09,599
we influence each other.

1055
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:11,839
If I'm in a room with someone who is

1056
00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:14,160
very angry, I'm going to start to feel

1057
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:16,319
sick

1058
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:18,640
or unwell.

1059
00:58:16,319 --> 00:58:20,640
If I'm in a room with someone beaming

1060
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:23,680
joy and love and happiness, I'm going to

1061
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:26,640
feel the same. I want to laugh. We are

1062
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:31,280
influencing each other. That is why we

1063
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:34,880
always need to use kind words,

1064
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:37,880
you know. um behave with respect and

1065
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:37,880
kindness.

1066
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:42,799
So

1067
00:58:40,079 --> 00:58:45,760
this is the

1068
00:58:42,799 --> 00:58:49,000
the journey of the soul and the nature

1069
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:49,000
of consciousness.

1070
00:58:51,599 --> 00:58:55,319
And um

1071
00:58:55,359 --> 00:59:02,400
I'm going to um I'm going to go in the

1072
00:58:57,839 --> 00:59:04,160
chat now and um see if you before going

1073
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:08,720
to the pun because it's a little bit

1074
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:11,760
early. Um has everyone understood?

1075
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:15,839
Um do you want me to go over again

1076
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:20,920
explain again um something because it's

1077
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:20,920
very uh very complex. So, um,

1078
00:59:21,119 --> 00:59:25,520
everything

1079
00:59:23,119 --> 00:59:28,480
you want me to talk about again or

1080
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:32,760
develop, please, um, just write it in

1081
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:32,760
the chat. I'm reading the chat.

1082
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:39,400
Actually, this

1083
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:52,359
here's Crystal.

1084
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:52,359
Okay, I knew that.

1085
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:58,280
So

1086
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:58,280
fantastic.

1087
00:59:59,839 --> 01:00:04,640
So when you've chosen to come to earth

1088
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:07,440
as an envoy,

1089
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:11,200
it's because on your home world, you

1090
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:12,880
have achieved all the cycles.

1091
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:15,880
You are you have your degree in

1092
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:15,880
reincarnation.

1093
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:25,240
How looks like source?

1094
01:00:25,599 --> 01:00:30,280
Well, source as I explain it's

1095
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:38,079
it's the creation. Um, when I help you

1096
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:40,640
visualize a a ball of energy from which

1097
01:00:38,079 --> 01:00:44,880
you shoot something,

1098
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:48,240
it's not exactly like this.

1099
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:50,799
the universe. Imagine. Okay. Imagine a

1100
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:55,440
planet.

1101
01:00:50,799 --> 01:00:59,119
We go better. Sorry. Visualize

1102
01:00:55,440 --> 01:01:03,920
a human body. Your body. Inside of it,

1103
01:00:59,119 --> 01:01:07,280
you have a soul

1104
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:09,440
with a consciousness.

1105
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:12,319
And this consciousness that you can call

1106
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:14,319
the higher self because it vibrates in a

1107
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:18,960
higher frequency

1108
01:01:14,319 --> 01:01:21,839
okay is a fractal of source. Okay. So

1109
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:24,720
body with a consciousness inside. Now

1110
01:01:21,839 --> 01:01:27,520
take a planet. It's the same planet with

1111
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:29,280
an electromagnetic field. You have the

1112
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:32,920
planet and the consciousness that

1113
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:32,920
inhabits it.

1114
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:40,240
Same as for the human body. The planet,

1115
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:44,079
the consciousness of the higher self is

1116
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:46,799
not a little being living in it.

1117
01:01:44,079 --> 01:01:49,680
Okay?

1118
01:01:46,799 --> 01:01:53,760
The field of consciousness

1119
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:56,720
is always radiating farther beyond your

1120
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:58,160
physical barriers of your body. Your

1121
01:01:56,720 --> 01:02:00,079
body is in it. It's not your

1122
01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:01,920
consciousness actually which is in your

1123
01:02:00,079 --> 01:02:05,359
body. It's your body which is in your

1124
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:07,839
consciousness. Um

1125
01:02:05,359 --> 01:02:10,079
same for a planet.

1126
01:02:07,839 --> 01:02:11,599
It's not a little thing living in the

1127
01:02:10,079 --> 01:02:14,319
center core of a planet. The

1128
01:02:11,599 --> 01:02:16,480
consciousness, for instance, Earth is it

1129
01:02:14,319 --> 01:02:19,359
is called Gaia by the ancient

1130
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:21,040
civilizations, notably the Greeks. Um we

1131
01:02:19,359 --> 01:02:23,440
like to call it Gaia, the consciousness

1132
01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:25,599
of Terra.

1133
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:28,640
Um

1134
01:02:25,599 --> 01:02:30,799
Terra is in it.

1135
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:34,240
Earth is in this consciousness. It's

1136
01:02:30,799 --> 01:02:37,440
consciousness. it radiates far beyond

1137
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:38,960
um its atmosphere.

1138
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:42,079
Okay,

1139
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:45,839
imagine now the a galaxy

1140
01:02:42,079 --> 01:02:48,640
the galaxies we call them mothers

1141
01:02:45,839 --> 01:02:53,240
because they are also sentient and

1142
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:53,240
inhabited by a galactic consciousness

1143
01:02:53,359 --> 01:02:58,400
which doesn't reside in the center but

1144
01:02:56,799 --> 01:03:02,559
is

1145
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:02,559
resides in the whole galaxy.

1146
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:11,280
Now let's just stop here for a moment.

1147
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:13,920
There is a center in a galaxy. There is

1148
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:15,839
a center in a planet and there is a

1149
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:19,839
center

1150
01:03:15,839 --> 01:03:22,960
vortex should I say also in the human

1151
01:03:19,839 --> 01:03:25,119
body. It's a pinal gland where the soul

1152
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:29,079
attaches

1153
01:03:25,119 --> 01:03:29,079
anchors three.

1154
01:03:29,359 --> 01:03:34,480
The pinal gland,

1155
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:37,760
the central core of a planet, of a star,

1156
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:40,559
of a galaxy, is a vortex that permits

1157
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:43,599
the entanglement of a consciousness to

1158
01:03:40,559 --> 01:03:46,640
the whole thing. It's the anchor point.

1159
01:03:43,599 --> 01:03:49,440
Okay? Is the anchor point.

1160
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:52,079
Okay? When you leave this body, you die.

1161
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:53,680
It's not really dying. You transition.

1162
01:03:52,079 --> 01:03:55,680
You're going, your soul is going to

1163
01:03:53,680 --> 01:04:00,359
leave through the pinal gland. That's

1164
01:03:55,680 --> 01:04:00,359
why you see this big vortex,

1165
01:04:02,079 --> 01:04:08,079
now

1166
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:10,319
let's go back to this bigger and bigger

1167
01:04:08,079 --> 01:04:13,680
and bigger

1168
01:04:10,319 --> 01:04:16,640
galaxies and now the universe.

1169
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:19,599
Galaxies it's not there are things in

1170
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:22,240
between. Galaxies are part of galactic

1171
01:04:19,599 --> 01:04:26,720
clusters like Lakia

1172
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:30,720
uh which Nataru is part of. Laniaakia is

1173
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:33,280
um a cluster of all the galaxies um that

1174
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:36,319
these neighboring galaxies

1175
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:39,680
and when you see Liaakia it's like a

1176
01:04:36,319 --> 01:04:43,119
brain of stardust like neurons of

1177
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:46,240
stardust and when you you you look at

1178
01:04:43,119 --> 01:04:48,559
the bigger scale the the bubble universe

1179
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:52,880
of ours

1180
01:04:48,559 --> 01:04:55,880
looks like a giant brain. Interesting.

1181
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:55,880
Well,

1182
01:04:56,079 --> 01:05:02,960
now this universe

1183
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:06,079
may have a center because it's a sphere

1184
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:08,000
and in this center there is an anchor

1185
01:05:06,079 --> 01:05:10,240
point for the consciousness of this

1186
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:13,520
universe

1187
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:16,520
which is still a fractile of source.

1188
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:16,520
Okay.

1189
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:22,720
And all these bubbles universe on the

1190
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:26,039
pattern of the flower of life compos the

1191
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:26,039
big universe.

1192
01:05:27,359 --> 01:05:31,440
And the big universe is not a fractal of

1193
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:38,160
source anymore because it's the last

1194
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:43,240
stage. And it is the body that contains

1195
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:43,240
the original consciousness of source.

1196
01:05:43,359 --> 01:05:51,000
The big thing, the big flower of life,

1197
01:05:45,359 --> 01:05:51,000
multi-dimensional thing. It is

1198
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:58,160
what source looks like.

1199
01:05:54,640 --> 01:06:01,680
That's what I saw in the mud.

1200
01:05:58,160 --> 01:06:05,720
The universe is the receptacle for the

1201
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:05,720
consciousness of source.

1202
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:13,520
It has a center

1203
01:06:09,839 --> 01:06:15,920
which is a vortex where the bubbles

1204
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:17,599
come out

1205
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:20,640
are created but they come from the

1206
01:06:17,599 --> 01:06:24,400
infinitely small

1207
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:27,680
into the infinitely big and it radiates

1208
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:30,319
from the center outwards.

1209
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:34,240
And it is how you can imagine also

1210
01:06:30,319 --> 01:06:36,160
source radiating from its center

1211
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:38,240
outwards.

1212
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:41,680
The center is the highest density and

1213
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:45,760
that is very important. Also

1214
01:06:41,680 --> 01:06:49,119
the center is um the highest density and

1215
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:51,680
as you went go out far from the center

1216
01:06:49,119 --> 01:06:54,400
it goes down in density. It radiates

1217
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:58,000
always from the center outwards. That's

1218
01:06:54,400 --> 01:07:00,960
why higher densities have an impact on

1219
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:05,440
lower densities. But lower densities do

1220
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:10,760
not have an impact on higher densities.

1221
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:10,760
Higher density in the center lower

1222
01:07:11,599 --> 01:07:18,720
slower slower density. We should say

1223
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:21,200
when you travel to the the the inner in

1224
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:22,960
inner earth to the center of the earth

1225
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:24,640
uh you are going to go higher and higher

1226
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:27,119
in density. The shambala is in the

1227
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:29,359
highest density in in in the center of

1228
01:07:27,119 --> 01:07:31,680
the earth. It that's how it works. And

1229
01:07:29,359 --> 01:07:33,440
it's the same for the human soul. The

1230
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:37,599
deeper you go within your soul, the

1231
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:40,559
higher you're going to climb in density.

1232
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:43,359
And embedded in you, you still have the

1233
01:07:40,559 --> 01:07:45,520
frequency code of the 13th of source.

1234
01:07:43,359 --> 01:07:47,440
That's why you can connect to it because

1235
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:50,240
it's the frequency key of the

1236
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:52,640
entanglement to source.

1237
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:54,640
So meditation is fantastic because when

1238
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:57,680
you introspect, when you really go

1239
01:07:54,640 --> 01:08:00,240
within, you you find this frequency key

1240
01:07:57,680 --> 01:08:05,799
of the 13th

1241
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:05,799
level, I would say, you know,

1242
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:12,400
and it's infinite.

1243
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:14,960
It's infinite.

1244
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:17,040
Um,

1245
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:19,600
oh, something I want to say as well. Oh,

1246
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:21,920
yes, I knew I forgot something.

1247
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:24,960
Um the nature regarding the nature of

1248
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:28,640
consciousness. Um

1249
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:30,319
different species cannot sometimes be

1250
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:34,319
compatible

1251
01:08:30,319 --> 01:08:37,199
means you grew up as a human. You were

1252
01:08:34,319 --> 01:08:40,799
on your home world. You developed as

1253
01:08:37,199 --> 01:08:42,719
human. The highest level of incarnation.

1254
01:08:40,799 --> 01:08:45,759
you know the micro inner circles of

1255
01:08:42,719 --> 01:08:47,600
incarnation on your planet in realms of

1256
01:08:45,759 --> 01:08:51,759
existence

1257
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:54,880
in your nature um where the highest for

1258
01:08:51,759 --> 01:08:57,440
instance the higher level was on your

1259
01:08:54,880 --> 01:09:00,239
planet on your home world it's human

1260
01:08:57,440 --> 01:09:03,199
okay

1261
01:09:00,239 --> 01:09:04,880
you because humans are individuated

1262
01:09:03,199 --> 01:09:07,440
consciousnesses

1263
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:10,640
they are not compatible with hive

1264
01:09:07,440 --> 01:09:14,239
consciousnesses so they cannot encounter

1265
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:17,839
ate in a body of a gray for instance and

1266
01:09:14,239 --> 01:09:21,040
respectively a gray consciousness cannot

1267
01:09:17,839 --> 01:09:22,880
incarnate into a body of a human

1268
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:24,880
because it's a hive structured

1269
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:28,480
consciousness.

1270
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:32,719
A a gray being who will have grown up on

1271
01:09:28,480 --> 01:09:36,640
a grayhive planet consciousness.

1272
01:09:32,719 --> 01:09:40,239
That's who we will have grown to be.

1273
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:42,560
And he cannot be anything else.

1274
01:09:40,239 --> 01:09:46,159
His consciousness has developed into

1275
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:48,960
becoming hive. It cannot go backwards.

1276
01:09:46,159 --> 01:09:53,920
He cannot rewind evolution.

1277
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:56,239
You cannot rewind evolution. So

1278
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:59,520
he will not this little gray will not be

1279
01:09:56,239 --> 01:10:02,000
able to incarnate into a human body.

1280
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:05,520
It will not catch. It would not anchor.

1281
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:09,159
It will not anchor

1282
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:09,159
except if

1283
01:10:09,679 --> 01:10:16,480
you genetically alter this human body,

1284
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:19,840
you create a hybrid

1285
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:22,159
or either you you you

1286
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:25,040
genetically transform this body with

1287
01:10:22,159 --> 01:10:27,440
enough gray DNA that the human

1288
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:31,080
consciousness cannot anchor anymore, but

1289
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:31,080
a gray can.

1290
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:42,040
There are two ways of doing it.

1291
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:42,040
Abducting humans and creating hybrids

1292
01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:46,040
or

1293
01:10:46,719 --> 01:10:52,199
injecting in these humans with their

1294
01:10:49,199 --> 01:10:52,199
consent

1295
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:59,440
products that are going to change their

1296
01:10:57,600 --> 01:11:01,360
genetics.

1297
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:04,800
and marinate

1298
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:06,960
all the all you know all this nonsense

1299
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:10,480
we've been going through with the the

1300
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:13,480
vax and you see

1301
01:11:10,480 --> 01:11:13,480
uh

1302
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:19,040
that was their plan

1303
01:11:16,159 --> 01:11:23,360
these this genetic modification because

1304
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:25,120
hybrid hybridization was failing they

1305
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:27,920
couldn't crack the code of human

1306
01:11:25,120 --> 01:11:29,679
consciousness they needed to go faster

1307
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:32,159
and they need to assimilate the whole

1308
01:11:29,679 --> 01:11:36,239
planet faster. The grays were losing,

1309
01:11:32,159 --> 01:11:39,440
the deep state was losing. Um, and it

1310
01:11:36,239 --> 01:11:42,400
needed to be a plan B to go faster and

1311
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:47,840
assimilate Earth be before everyone

1312
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:52,640
wakes up. Too bad. Well,

1313
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:58,280
they decided to create these injections

1314
01:11:52,640 --> 01:11:58,280
to modify human genetics to grays.

1315
01:11:58,320 --> 01:12:03,840
It didn't work

1316
01:12:01,040 --> 01:12:05,840
because even though the people who did

1317
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:10,159
it

1318
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:12,480
uh harm their body but some many of them

1319
01:12:10,159 --> 01:12:16,000
died because the body rejected the

1320
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:21,000
genetics. It didn't catch well. It it

1321
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:21,000
was there was a lethal reaction.

1322
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:26,960
Many surv most of them survived

1323
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:28,560
and for those who survived it depend on

1324
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:32,320
the DNA and the blood types. For those

1325
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:35,600
who survived, they had to

1326
01:12:32,320 --> 01:12:37,760
um then interface them to the hive

1327
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:39,280
because they had the genetic signal. And

1328
01:12:37,760 --> 01:12:43,040
there was a substance which was the

1329
01:12:39,280 --> 01:12:45,520
graphine which was supposed to be uh

1330
01:12:43,040 --> 01:12:49,120
connecting the the human consciousness

1331
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:51,920
to the hive to assimilate people on a

1332
01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:55,679
signal that never happened because the

1333
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:59,360
hive was destroyed in time. Thank you,

1334
01:12:55,679 --> 01:13:00,960
High Commander Denithor.

1335
01:12:59,360 --> 01:13:03,360
Um,

1336
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:06,560
that's how the destiny of Earth changed

1337
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:10,640
the destiny of the galaxy.

1338
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:13,600
So, a gray and human are incompatible

1339
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:17,960
unless genetic alterations through

1340
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:17,960
hybridization or injections.

1341
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:25,360
Same with reptilian soul matrix.

1342
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:27,199
Reptilians are um we haven't spoken

1343
01:13:25,360 --> 01:13:29,840
about them yet. You know in this

1344
01:13:27,199 --> 01:13:33,440
universe there are

1345
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:35,760
three no I say in this galaxy because in

1346
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:39,440
the universe there are other races in

1347
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:43,920
Nataru the mother Nataru

1348
01:13:39,440 --> 01:13:46,320
there are three main um leading genetic

1349
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:48,159
species the humans the reptilians and

1350
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:50,480
the grays. There are many others but

1351
01:13:48,159 --> 01:13:55,520
these are the three principle and on

1352
01:13:50,480 --> 01:13:58,840
these three uh a lot of subspecies are

1353
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:58,840
uh derived

1354
01:13:59,920 --> 01:14:07,280
the humans or humans humans you have

1355
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:10,960
from another galaxy you have the agony

1356
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:14,239
which are human vegetital that that's a

1357
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:17,440
beauty that's a beautiful exception it's

1358
01:14:14,239 --> 01:14:20,719
absolutely amazing but that's not the

1359
01:14:17,440 --> 01:14:24,719
norm in Nataru.

1360
01:14:20,719 --> 01:14:28,480
Humans are humans period. Here then you

1361
01:14:24,719 --> 01:14:32,080
have um the grays. The grays are hives

1362
01:14:28,480 --> 01:14:36,800
but they can be grays can be reptil gray

1363
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:40,239
reptilian or gray insecttoids.

1364
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:43,679
Okay. Grays are either gray reptilian or

1365
01:14:40,239 --> 01:14:46,719
gray insecttoid. You have gray humans

1366
01:14:43,679 --> 01:14:49,760
like the soyperai like the immers and

1367
01:14:46,719 --> 01:14:52,640
their individual consciousness.

1368
01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:54,800
Okay. Gray humans human soul can

1369
01:14:52,640 --> 01:14:58,080
incarnate in them but they cannot

1370
01:14:54,800 --> 01:15:00,080
behive. They cannot be assimulated.

1371
01:14:58,080 --> 01:15:03,040
Immersi

1372
01:15:00,080 --> 01:15:07,120
for instance

1373
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:09,199
um gray but they are more rare. gray uh

1374
01:15:07,120 --> 01:15:12,960
insecttoids.

1375
01:15:09,199 --> 01:15:15,199
You have um oh I don't remember most of

1376
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:19,199
them but the mantids are gray gray

1377
01:15:15,199 --> 01:15:22,320
insecttoids and you have gray reptilians

1378
01:15:19,199 --> 01:15:24,320
uh such as the mitra maitra are gray

1379
01:15:22,320 --> 01:15:28,000
reptilians.

1380
01:15:24,320 --> 01:15:32,159
So um

1381
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:36,000
these are compatible with reptilians

1382
01:15:32,159 --> 01:15:39,320
uh with insecttoids with humans in their

1383
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:39,320
own categories.

1384
01:15:40,480 --> 01:15:46,560
Why did I want to go with that? Um

1385
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:48,480
yeah the graas they are these three

1386
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:51,440
strands but the reptilians they're

1387
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:53,280
reptilians.

1388
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:56,239
There are some species who are reptilian

1389
01:15:53,280 --> 01:15:59,199
human but but they they all

1390
01:15:56,239 --> 01:16:00,880
individuated. You have reptilians in

1391
01:15:59,199 --> 01:16:03,520
general they are individuated

1392
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:05,520
consciousness groups but you can have

1393
01:16:03,520 --> 01:16:07,280
reptilian hives but when you have

1394
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:11,600
reptilian hives it mean there are great

1395
01:16:07,280 --> 01:16:14,800
genetics in um in it. Uh so it's all

1396
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:18,560
always comes down to to to grays. The

1397
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:21,360
most dangerous highs are the the gray

1398
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:24,800
insecttoids because they're like this.

1399
01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:27,520
They they think the same. This is

1400
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:30,080
incredible. Incredible.

1401
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:32,800
Like birds flying in in in the sky. Oh,

1402
01:16:30,080 --> 01:16:34,640
birds. It's interesting. Birds are an

1403
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:36,719
individuated

1404
01:16:34,640 --> 01:16:39,600
collective consciousness. They have

1405
01:16:36,719 --> 01:16:42,640
their own individuation, but they when

1406
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:46,400
they fly, they can interface and have

1407
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:49,040
one brain. It's very interesting.

1408
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:52,320
Um,

1409
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:54,560
so no organic interface between hive and

1410
01:16:52,320 --> 01:16:59,760
individuated. It's impossible unless

1411
01:16:54,560 --> 01:17:03,199
genetic alteration and um there's an the

1412
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:07,199
incompatibility between human and gray

1413
01:17:03,199 --> 01:17:10,239
uh and reptilians u

1414
01:17:07,199 --> 01:17:13,760
generated the the hybridization programs

1415
01:17:10,239 --> 01:17:17,040
on earth to try to

1416
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:18,640
merge merge the consciousness into human

1417
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:20,880
bodies

1418
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:23,440
because human bodies are gifts. They are

1419
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:25,360
temples. They are so powerful. The

1420
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:31,040
genetics, the DNA of the human body can

1421
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:34,640
achieve so much. Create, create.

1422
01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:38,719
So, um

1423
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:41,600
I think that's it for um for the

1424
01:17:38,719 --> 01:17:46,000
explanations and I am going to uh read

1425
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:50,560
the questions now. So, um

1426
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:52,480
going to have a bit of tea and tea

1427
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:56,520
break.

1428
01:17:52,480 --> 01:17:56,520
I'll be with you in a minute.

1429
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:09,400
No,

1430
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:14,800
every everybody's fine.

1431
01:18:12,239 --> 01:18:17,360
I feel the buzzing of energy in this

1432
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:20,880
chat. I I haven't read it really. I'm

1433
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:23,199
reading it now. Um,

1434
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:27,280
so

1435
01:18:23,199 --> 01:18:31,440
I am going to

1436
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:37,360
go I'm opening the questions now.

1437
01:18:31,440 --> 01:18:40,679
And so uh for with 40 uh 40 uh votes,

1438
01:18:37,360 --> 01:18:40,679
it's incredible.

1439
01:18:41,360 --> 01:18:48,320
Uh question from Pierre.

1440
01:18:45,120 --> 01:18:51,560
Okay, I'm going to put it on screen and

1441
01:18:48,320 --> 01:18:51,560
read it.

1442
01:18:52,159 --> 01:18:56,480
Deina,

1443
01:18:53,679 --> 01:19:01,120
what is the purpose of having a royalty

1444
01:18:56,480 --> 01:19:05,600
in our universe? Interesting question. I

1445
01:19:01,120 --> 01:19:07,840
understood we should be

1446
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:10,239
have a reflection. I understood we

1447
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:12,480
should be all equal brothers and

1448
01:19:10,239 --> 01:19:14,800
sisters. Why should there be another

1449
01:19:12,480 --> 01:19:18,000
kind of difference built on top of our

1450
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:21,000
equality? Is it a question of the source

1451
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:21,000
origin?

1452
01:19:21,040 --> 01:19:27,360
Um,

1453
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:30,239
sorry. Ah, lost it. Sorry, I tried to

1454
01:19:27,360 --> 01:19:34,920
scroll down. Sorry. Uh, is it a question

1455
01:19:30,239 --> 01:19:34,920
of source origin?

1456
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:43,600
Excuse me. That's why long questions are

1457
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:46,840
difficult because I have to uh

1458
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:46,840
move it.

1459
01:19:47,440 --> 01:19:55,000
Quality level of capacity in compassion

1460
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:55,000
or is it another plan

1461
01:19:55,679 --> 01:20:00,400
built up to take advantage of the rest

1462
01:19:57,920 --> 01:20:03,600
of incarnated beings? Shouldn't we be

1463
01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:06,159
all equal finally? Finally. Okay. When

1464
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:11,280
you have uh royalties,

1465
01:20:06,159 --> 01:20:14,400
it's not really about um all the time

1466
01:20:11,280 --> 01:20:17,400
about supremacy of a cast of beings on

1467
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:17,400
others.

1468
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:26,560
Royalty can be from different

1469
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:30,080
origin. you have um a royalty that will

1470
01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:33,440
be the structure of a society, the head

1471
01:20:30,080 --> 01:20:38,080
of a structure of a society to make the

1472
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:41,120
so society work. Imagine an an a company

1473
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:44,000
you need a CEO.

1474
01:20:41,120 --> 01:20:45,920
If you don't have a CEO, all the

1475
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:48,239
employees

1476
01:20:45,920 --> 01:20:50,320
will then the company will fail because

1477
01:20:48,239 --> 01:20:52,560
everyone will do whatever they want and

1478
01:20:50,320 --> 01:20:56,400
they will organically try to organize to

1479
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:59,840
elect a chief. That's how it works. in

1480
01:20:56,400 --> 01:21:01,840
all the society. You elect a guy who's

1481
01:20:59,840 --> 01:21:04,159
going to be in charge and he's going to

1482
01:21:01,840 --> 01:21:06,719
take all responsibility

1483
01:21:04,159 --> 01:21:08,960
and who's going to try to organize the

1484
01:21:06,719 --> 01:21:11,440
society and you're going to go to

1485
01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:15,280
complain to this guy. Hey, this one hurt

1486
01:21:11,440 --> 01:21:19,040
me, hurt him or you know and this person

1487
01:21:15,280 --> 01:21:22,080
stole my stuff. Please make justice. You

1488
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:27,199
need in a in any society, you need a guy

1489
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:29,440
or whatever at the top that is going to

1490
01:21:27,199 --> 01:21:32,000
uh organize the society and make sure

1491
01:21:29,440 --> 01:21:35,280
everything's safe, everyone's safe and

1492
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:39,600
everyone's fed, you know, and every and

1493
01:21:35,280 --> 01:21:42,719
the the the the tribe is is is safe and

1494
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:44,239
protected from the enemy, you know. So

1495
01:21:42,719 --> 01:21:47,280
he's going this person is going to

1496
01:21:44,239 --> 01:21:50,640
decide of agreements with other tribes

1497
01:21:47,280 --> 01:21:54,239
for business commerce that that's why

1498
01:21:50,640 --> 01:21:56,800
you have had royalties and governments.

1499
01:21:54,239 --> 01:21:58,639
Well, I know governments on earth are

1500
01:21:56,800 --> 01:22:01,199
all corrupted but it's not the norm in

1501
01:21:58,639 --> 01:22:02,960
the universe. Okay.

1502
01:22:01,199 --> 01:22:05,280
So

1503
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:07,679
then you have people in charge who take

1504
01:22:05,280 --> 01:22:10,320
advantage. you have people in charge who

1505
01:22:07,679 --> 01:22:12,080
are going to

1506
01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:15,360
to

1507
01:22:12,080 --> 01:22:17,040
start to be corrupted and and be really

1508
01:22:15,360 --> 01:22:19,920
um

1509
01:22:17,040 --> 01:22:22,000
toxic for the the society, you know. So

1510
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:25,440
that's

1511
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:27,600
that's what it is. That's what it is.

1512
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:29,520
It's quite a universal structure.

1513
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:33,360
Anyway,

1514
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:36,679
next question from Jacqueline.

1515
01:22:33,360 --> 01:22:36,679
Hello Jacqueline.

1516
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:42,719
Are our souls multi-dimensional? I can

1517
01:22:40,719 --> 01:22:45,280
can't read. Do we have a few

1518
01:22:42,719 --> 01:22:47,040
incarnations occurring at that same

1519
01:22:45,280 --> 01:22:50,480
time?

1520
01:22:47,040 --> 01:22:54,880
Could there be Oh, say okay. Could there

1521
01:22:50,480 --> 01:22:57,280
be an other part of my soul here on

1522
01:22:54,880 --> 01:22:59,199
Earth and other planets? Are we

1523
01:22:57,280 --> 01:23:01,760
communicating through consciousness?

1524
01:22:59,199 --> 01:23:03,280
Thank you. Are our souls

1525
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:05,280
multi-dimensional?

1526
01:23:03,280 --> 01:23:09,040
Do we have a few incarnation occurring

1527
01:23:05,280 --> 01:23:10,880
at that same time? I'm very glad

1528
01:23:09,040 --> 01:23:14,520
Jacqueline you said you put you you as

1529
01:23:10,880 --> 01:23:14,520
this question because

1530
01:23:14,960 --> 01:23:24,320
when a soul fractals from creator

1531
01:23:19,520 --> 01:23:27,920
and arrives on a world on a planet okay

1532
01:23:24,320 --> 01:23:30,480
this soul is one this individuality is

1533
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:32,800
one

1534
01:23:30,480 --> 01:23:37,440
it's going to incarnate in one body at a

1535
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:40,560
time when the the soul merges interface

1536
01:23:37,440 --> 01:23:42,639
faces with matter with a body.

1537
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:46,480
This body is going to start to grow and

1538
01:23:42,639 --> 01:23:49,440
decay and when it decay has has finished

1539
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:52,239
then

1540
01:23:49,440 --> 01:23:55,199
the so is going to go out and go into a

1541
01:23:52,239 --> 01:23:57,520
new body.

1542
01:23:55,199 --> 01:24:01,320
Some species like the gman for instance

1543
01:23:57,520 --> 01:24:01,320
are able to

1544
01:24:01,360 --> 01:24:07,120
front bodies

1545
01:24:03,520 --> 01:24:08,960
that's typ typical to them. Um you have

1546
01:24:07,120 --> 01:24:10,480
species like this in the universe who do

1547
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:12,639
that.

1548
01:24:10,480 --> 01:24:16,800
You can also

1549
01:24:12,639 --> 01:24:21,520
uh fractal a consciousness

1550
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:25,679
a piece of it same as source does. You

1551
01:24:21,520 --> 01:24:27,920
are going to take a piece of it and um

1552
01:24:25,679 --> 01:24:31,199
put it in another body. But these two

1553
01:24:27,920 --> 01:24:33,920
bodies will be entangled then you know

1554
01:24:31,199 --> 01:24:36,880
you can do that but that's artificially

1555
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:39,520
made. It's not natural and the two souls

1556
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:43,760
are uh the two fractals of the same soul

1557
01:24:39,520 --> 01:24:46,320
are feeling un incomplete and lacking

1558
01:24:43,760 --> 01:24:50,239
the other part and it's suffering

1559
01:24:46,320 --> 01:24:53,040
involved. You know u when pe when some

1560
01:24:50,239 --> 01:24:55,920
species do clones they start they

1561
01:24:53,040 --> 01:24:58,560
started that they always okay many

1562
01:24:55,920 --> 01:25:01,840
civilizations start when they start to

1563
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:05,920
do clones they start to uh fractile the

1564
01:25:01,840 --> 01:25:08,880
consciousness the the the the origin

1565
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:10,719
consciousness of the body that served

1566
01:25:08,880 --> 01:25:15,199
for cloning.

1567
01:25:10,719 --> 01:25:19,199
But they will uh realize very fast that

1568
01:25:15,199 --> 01:25:21,679
cloning reconing reconing there's an

1569
01:25:19,199 --> 01:25:24,239
um decay of the soul. There's an

1570
01:25:21,679 --> 01:25:26,480
alteration of the soul and the soul just

1571
01:25:24,239 --> 01:25:29,679
collapses on itself.

1572
01:25:26,480 --> 01:25:33,040
So what these people understand it's

1573
01:25:29,679 --> 01:25:36,000
that then you need to create artificial

1574
01:25:33,040 --> 01:25:39,760
consciousness supercomputed

1575
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:41,520
program that act like consciousness. A

1576
01:25:39,760 --> 01:25:43,679
lot of grays have that. A lot of grays

1577
01:25:41,520 --> 01:25:46,239
have that. If you want to massroduce

1578
01:25:43,679 --> 01:25:49,360
clones to do armies, you need AI. You

1579
01:25:46,239 --> 01:25:51,120
need AI. You cannot do it from one

1580
01:25:49,360 --> 01:25:54,960
origin consciousness. It's impossible.

1581
01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:58,080
It decays after a few few clones.

1582
01:25:54,960 --> 01:26:01,480
So um

1583
01:25:58,080 --> 01:26:01,480
here we go.

1584
01:26:03,920 --> 01:26:07,920
I hope it answers your question. No. So

1585
01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:10,320
no, you don't have uh any other uh

1586
01:26:07,920 --> 01:26:14,800
altars of you in different dimensions.

1587
01:26:10,320 --> 01:26:17,440
It's not possible. Um it's against

1588
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:20,080
the the the the laws of the universe,

1589
01:26:17,440 --> 01:26:23,960
the science, you know. So it's not

1590
01:26:20,080 --> 01:26:23,960
possible. Um

1591
01:26:24,400 --> 01:26:28,639
I read your question again.

1592
01:26:27,280 --> 01:26:31,199
Are we communicating through

1593
01:26:28,639 --> 01:26:34,000
consciousness?

1594
01:26:31,199 --> 01:26:36,719
If you feel that may serve other people,

1595
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:39,199
if you feel uh Jacqueline, you are

1596
01:26:36,719 --> 01:26:42,159
communicating with someone in another

1597
01:26:39,199 --> 01:26:46,320
dimension. It's not a part of yourself.

1598
01:26:42,159 --> 01:26:48,239
It's a member of your soul cluster.

1599
01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:50,320
Yes.

1600
01:26:48,239 --> 01:26:52,000
because you can incarnate in other

1601
01:26:50,320 --> 01:26:54,480
universe as well, you know. You can do

1602
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:58,000
that. You can do that.

1603
01:26:54,480 --> 01:26:59,520
Um, okay.

1604
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:01,120
Thank you, Jacqueline, for allowing me

1605
01:26:59,520 --> 01:27:04,320
to talk about that. It's a great

1606
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:07,679
question. Another question from

1607
01:27:04,320 --> 01:27:09,760
37 votes. I need to scroll down. Aa

1608
01:27:07,679 --> 01:27:12,560
Louisa Carter.

1609
01:27:09,760 --> 01:27:14,880
Hello. Hi, beautiful Elena. You have

1610
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:18,800
mentioned the importance of a soul DNA

1611
01:27:14,880 --> 01:27:25,080
match. Yes. Example, a tal needs to

1612
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:25,080
incarnate into bodies with tal DNA

1613
01:27:25,679 --> 01:27:30,080
but doesn't displace this place severe

1614
01:27:28,400 --> 01:27:33,840
constraint on a soul's ability to

1615
01:27:30,080 --> 01:27:35,840
incarnate in other physicalities.

1616
01:27:33,840 --> 01:27:39,199
What if a soul wanted to incarnate into

1617
01:27:35,840 --> 01:27:42,239
an unrelated race? Could they do it or

1618
01:27:39,199 --> 01:27:43,920
are they always restricted by DNA?

1619
01:27:42,239 --> 01:27:47,040
Perhaps you can do a webinar on the

1620
01:27:43,920 --> 01:27:50,880
culture of the era. I would be awesome.

1621
01:27:47,040 --> 01:27:53,280
Good idea. Thank you. No, you need an

1622
01:27:50,880 --> 01:27:56,000
entanglement.

1623
01:27:53,280 --> 01:27:57,760
You need a frequency.

1624
01:27:56,000 --> 01:28:01,600
Entanglement. That means you need a

1625
01:27:57,760 --> 01:28:04,480
marker, a DNA marker that is frequency

1626
01:28:01,600 --> 01:28:07,840
will resonate with

1627
01:28:04,480 --> 01:28:10,159
your original um

1628
01:28:07,840 --> 01:28:13,159
home world frequency.

1629
01:28:10,159 --> 01:28:13,159
So

1630
01:28:13,440 --> 01:28:19,840
the thing is the more you reincarnate in

1631
01:28:17,120 --> 01:28:22,880
different species

1632
01:28:19,840 --> 01:28:25,199
with the percent of the DNA you

1633
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:29,280
corresponding to you the more you will

1634
01:28:25,199 --> 01:28:32,280
be able to diversify at long term. I

1635
01:28:29,280 --> 01:28:32,280
explain

1636
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:39,920
you leave your own word for the first

1637
01:28:35,760 --> 01:28:42,960
time you're going to incarnate in on era

1638
01:28:39,920 --> 01:28:46,320
planet era in the pleades

1639
01:28:42,960 --> 01:28:49,040
the era the era body needs to have for

1640
01:28:46,320 --> 01:28:52,880
instance you are from

1641
01:28:49,040 --> 01:28:55,440
from alia that's a simple example I have

1642
01:28:52,880 --> 01:29:00,960
from another galaxy you will need to

1643
01:28:55,440 --> 01:29:06,239
find to entangle to um ael body who has

1644
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:08,320
uh a good percentage of um Alian DNA

1645
01:29:06,239 --> 01:29:10,480
then there's a resonance and there can

1646
01:29:08,320 --> 01:29:13,520
be there can be an entanglement a

1647
01:29:10,480 --> 01:29:17,520
resonance of frequency you know if the

1648
01:29:13,520 --> 01:29:19,920
point B doesn't exist you can't go there

1649
01:29:17,520 --> 01:29:23,040
but then because your soul will have

1650
01:29:19,920 --> 01:29:26,800
experienced a hell frequency genetic in

1651
01:29:23,040 --> 01:29:28,639
this body also this new body the next

1652
01:29:26,800 --> 01:29:31,120
time

1653
01:29:28,639 --> 01:29:34,239
you will have also the opportunity to

1654
01:29:31,120 --> 01:29:37,360
incarnate into an anahel body because

1655
01:29:34,239 --> 01:29:41,440
your consciousness will have assimulated

1656
01:29:37,360 --> 01:29:44,000
also the frequency of the era

1657
01:29:41,440 --> 01:29:47,600
and so on and so on and so on. So the

1658
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:50,400
more you incarnate in in diverse races

1659
01:29:47,600 --> 01:29:52,000
the easiest is going to be for you to

1660
01:29:50,400 --> 01:29:54,880
pick different race you want to

1661
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:59,199
incarnate into. It's going to and then

1662
01:29:54,880 --> 01:30:02,960
after a good while your soul, your human

1663
01:29:59,199 --> 01:30:05,280
soul worth a lot in the currency of the

1664
01:30:02,960 --> 01:30:08,000
universe because you will have the

1665
01:30:05,280 --> 01:30:11,760
frequency keys of many different other

1666
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:15,679
races and that's precious.

1667
01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:17,920
So that's why human consciousness

1668
01:30:15,679 --> 01:30:24,159
and human DNA

1669
01:30:17,920 --> 01:30:24,159
both are currencies in this galaxy.

1670
01:30:24,719 --> 01:30:30,560
Now we have a question from I'm going to

1671
01:30:26,960 --> 01:30:32,880
try to answer most as possible

1672
01:30:30,560 --> 01:30:37,199
from solar

1673
01:30:32,880 --> 01:30:40,159
faithful um follower.

1674
01:30:37,199 --> 01:30:42,080
Dear Elena, are souls of all beings

1675
01:30:40,159 --> 01:30:45,120
blocked from remembering their previous

1676
01:30:42,080 --> 01:30:51,080
lives? Oh, great question. or is it just

1677
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:51,080
a human soul issue issue issue issue?

1678
01:30:53,440 --> 01:30:58,000
I'm trying to understand how we add

1679
01:30:55,600 --> 01:31:00,800
wisdom if we keep forgetting our past

1680
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:02,960
lives. Thank you so much for everything

1681
01:31:00,800 --> 01:31:05,840
you share. We've all grown wiser through

1682
01:31:02,960 --> 01:31:09,199
your words. Much love. Oh, thank you.

1683
01:31:05,840 --> 01:31:11,840
So, I'm going to go through this.

1684
01:31:09,199 --> 01:31:15,600
Are souls of all beings blocked from

1685
01:31:11,840 --> 01:31:20,719
remembering their previous lives? No,

1686
01:31:15,600 --> 01:31:23,280
when you okay when you inc you are from

1687
01:31:20,719 --> 01:31:25,600
a certain density for instance six and

1688
01:31:23,280 --> 01:31:31,239
you are going to incarnate into lower

1689
01:31:25,600 --> 01:31:31,239
density fifth fourth or third

1690
01:31:31,600 --> 01:31:37,040
that's going to hurt third usually you

1691
01:31:34,639 --> 01:31:40,080
go down two densities it's it's okay

1692
01:31:37,040 --> 01:31:44,320
then you start to really hurt

1693
01:31:40,080 --> 01:31:47,120
you you will lose your memory dream

1694
01:31:44,320 --> 01:31:49,840
unless you have a special mission

1695
01:31:47,120 --> 01:31:53,280
at me. I haven't lost my memory. I have

1696
01:31:49,840 --> 01:31:57,920
a perpetual memory in time of my

1697
01:31:53,280 --> 01:32:02,239
previous lives. But the

1698
01:31:57,920 --> 01:32:04,400
it's not forgotten. It's just switched

1699
01:32:02,239 --> 01:32:06,239
off.

1700
01:32:04,400 --> 01:32:08,080
That means at any moment when you

1701
01:32:06,239 --> 01:32:09,760
activate the connection the frequency

1702
01:32:08,080 --> 01:32:13,520
connection with your soul your higher

1703
01:32:09,760 --> 01:32:17,280
being poof you remember that is why I'm

1704
01:32:13,520 --> 01:32:21,520
all I'm telling you when you ask me am I

1705
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:24,480
a plleadian am I this am I that

1706
01:32:21,520 --> 01:32:28,159
you don't need to do hypnosis you don't

1707
01:32:24,480 --> 01:32:31,600
need to to do you you to go and see

1708
01:32:28,159 --> 01:32:35,760
anyone you have the answers

1709
01:32:31,600 --> 01:32:38,159
your higher self knows pose.

1710
01:32:35,760 --> 01:32:40,560
So, switch off your brain, do

1711
01:32:38,159 --> 01:32:43,920
meditation,

1712
01:32:40,560 --> 01:32:46,480
meet the frequency of this being inside

1713
01:32:43,920 --> 01:32:50,400
and know your memory is there. Your

1714
01:32:46,480 --> 01:32:53,120
memory is there. You'll find it.

1715
01:32:50,400 --> 01:32:58,440
So, that's one. Uh, was it was there

1716
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:58,440
something else in there? Um,

1717
01:32:58,639 --> 01:33:05,639
so

1718
01:33:00,719 --> 01:33:05,639
is it just a human soul issue?

1719
01:33:08,639 --> 01:33:16,159
Humans for sure it's difficult to

1720
01:33:11,440 --> 01:33:18,639
remember, but um other races also it

1721
01:33:16,159 --> 01:33:21,520
happens for them like this. It it would

1722
01:33:18,639 --> 01:33:26,000
be too long to uh go over the the other

1723
01:33:21,520 --> 01:33:27,840
races. There's something as well. um

1724
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:31,520
that Enlil,

1725
01:33:27,840 --> 01:33:34,480
the Anarch bastard Enlil has done to

1726
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:37,040
humans on Earth by altering their DNA

1727
01:33:34,480 --> 01:33:38,880
with his teams.

1728
01:33:37,040 --> 01:33:41,840
They

1729
01:33:38,880 --> 01:33:46,000
brought back the age the life the

1730
01:33:41,840 --> 01:33:48,960
lifespan of humans to really low in

1731
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:51,679
throughout the the the the galaxy

1732
01:33:48,960 --> 01:33:55,360
lifespan of a human being such a tal and

1733
01:33:51,679 --> 01:33:58,159
a hell or whatever it's

1734
01:33:55,360 --> 01:34:02,080
several hundred years sometimes to a

1735
01:33:58,159 --> 01:34:04,080
thousand or more

1736
01:34:02,080 --> 01:34:06,639
you know

1737
01:34:04,080 --> 01:34:10,719
living up to

1738
01:34:06,639 --> 01:34:14,639
80 years old and old 80 years old and

1739
01:34:10,719 --> 01:34:17,040
and and just collapse. It's unnatural

1740
01:34:14,639 --> 01:34:20,320
for humans.

1741
01:34:17,040 --> 01:34:23,920
Humans should live

1742
01:34:20,320 --> 01:34:28,440
7 8 900 years.

1743
01:34:23,920 --> 01:34:28,440
But when you leave that long

1744
01:34:29,199 --> 01:34:37,440
um when you leave that long, you start

1745
01:34:34,159 --> 01:34:41,600
to gain wisdom and knowledge, accumulate

1746
01:34:37,440 --> 01:34:44,320
knowledge and gain wisdom and because

1747
01:34:41,600 --> 01:34:48,719
you're not going to become old at 80 and

1748
01:34:44,320 --> 01:34:50,480
then be old your next

1749
01:34:48,719 --> 01:34:54,000
800 years. No, you're going to be young

1750
01:34:50,480 --> 01:34:56,719
at 80, very young. and keep on being

1751
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:59,280
young until you're maybe 700. You know

1752
01:34:56,719 --> 01:35:01,600
what I mean? And the brain is young. So

1753
01:34:59,280 --> 01:35:04,000
you can really remember and assimilate

1754
01:35:01,600 --> 01:35:06,639
knowledge and become wise elder and

1755
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:09,040
become wise

1756
01:35:06,639 --> 01:35:11,280
and didn't want this and li wanted to

1757
01:35:09,040 --> 01:35:14,719
enslave humanity

1758
01:35:11,280 --> 01:35:17,199
as because you you realize when you

1759
01:35:14,719 --> 01:35:20,080
reach out to a certain age you start to

1760
01:35:17,199 --> 01:35:24,320
get it but then it's too late and you

1761
01:35:20,080 --> 01:35:27,440
die. It's it's it's it's frustrating

1762
01:35:24,320 --> 01:35:30,400
and done that to us.

1763
01:35:27,440 --> 01:35:32,239
But the bloodline that um IA preserved

1764
01:35:30,400 --> 01:35:35,840
and activated,

1765
01:35:32,239 --> 01:35:38,719
you know, the Adamic bloodline,

1766
01:35:35,840 --> 01:35:44,080
they could live, these humans could live

1767
01:35:38,719 --> 01:35:47,360
up to 800 years. The patriarchs,

1768
01:35:44,080 --> 01:35:50,800
look at their ages in the Bible.

1769
01:35:47,360 --> 01:35:54,159
is because these were normally activated

1770
01:35:50,800 --> 01:35:56,880
humans with all their powers thanks to

1771
01:35:54,159 --> 01:36:00,320
IA.

1772
01:35:56,880 --> 01:36:03,760
But as we know,

1773
01:36:00,320 --> 01:36:09,320
IA didn't win this battle and the the

1774
01:36:03,760 --> 01:36:09,320
the the winners wrote history.

1775
01:36:17,840 --> 01:36:23,600
That's how it went.

1776
01:36:21,120 --> 01:36:28,480
Now, IA has brought back the diademic

1777
01:36:23,600 --> 01:36:30,320
DNA. The the the sample, the key is

1778
01:36:28,480 --> 01:36:32,239
given back. This sample to the Earth

1779
01:36:30,320 --> 01:36:37,120
Alliance. It's been implemented in the

1780
01:36:32,239 --> 01:36:39,920
new medbed. And if you choose to repare

1781
01:36:37,120 --> 01:36:42,920
your DNA, your altered DNA with this

1782
01:36:39,920 --> 01:36:42,920
pattern,

1783
01:36:43,280 --> 01:36:50,159
you will leave all these years

1784
01:36:46,239 --> 01:36:55,239
which are the normal average biological

1785
01:36:50,159 --> 01:36:55,239
lifespan of a human being.

1786
01:37:00,800 --> 01:37:07,679
Good evening, Moira. You have a question

1787
01:37:03,360 --> 01:37:10,880
with 32 votes. Um,

1788
01:37:07,679 --> 01:37:13,760
dear Selena, you are awesome. Thank you.

1789
01:37:10,880 --> 01:37:15,840
You too, all of you. I'm wondering how

1790
01:37:13,760 --> 01:37:18,560
to connect to our original soul group

1791
01:37:15,840 --> 01:37:21,119
and planetary matrix. I have tried

1792
01:37:18,560 --> 01:37:23,679
through meditation and psychedelics, but

1793
01:37:21,119 --> 01:37:27,119
I'm still unaware of where I truly come

1794
01:37:23,679 --> 01:37:29,520
from or where my soul's origin point is.

1795
01:37:27,119 --> 01:37:32,159
Please enlighten. Thank you so much,

1796
01:37:29,520 --> 01:37:36,480
love. Now this question mora is really

1797
01:37:32,159 --> 01:37:39,280
to going to benefit the many.

1798
01:37:36,480 --> 01:37:41,920
So um

1799
01:37:39,280 --> 01:37:46,920
how to connect to our original soul

1800
01:37:41,920 --> 01:37:46,920
group and planetary matrix

1801
01:37:52,800 --> 01:37:59,960
really do try it again. I know it's not

1802
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:59,960
a good answer but

1803
01:38:01,360 --> 01:38:05,600
the silence

1804
01:38:03,360 --> 01:38:08,400
silence the outside

1805
01:38:05,600 --> 01:38:10,880
go within I know it's difficult it's

1806
01:38:08,400 --> 01:38:13,679
difficult to hear your frequency Moira

1807
01:38:10,880 --> 01:38:17,040
because there are still too much noise

1808
01:38:13,679 --> 01:38:21,280
around you in your head too much worries

1809
01:38:17,040 --> 01:38:22,719
maybe uh too much thoughts and you hear

1810
01:38:21,280 --> 01:38:24,880
the frequency of your thoughts the

1811
01:38:22,719 --> 01:38:26,400
frequency of the influence turns

1812
01:38:24,880 --> 01:38:28,480
outside.

1813
01:38:26,400 --> 01:38:31,920
Even if it is in a subconscious and you

1814
01:38:28,480 --> 01:38:35,360
do not hear your frequency,

1815
01:38:31,920 --> 01:38:38,719
go in quiet places.

1816
01:38:35,360 --> 01:38:40,400
Try to silence

1817
01:38:38,719 --> 01:38:43,760
temporarily

1818
01:38:40,400 --> 01:38:45,360
the emotions, the distractions, the

1819
01:38:43,760 --> 01:38:50,719
worries.

1820
01:38:45,360 --> 01:38:56,000
That will help you greatly to go within.

1821
01:38:50,719 --> 01:38:58,400
Psychedelics may help but they are not,

1822
01:38:56,000 --> 01:39:02,080
you know, it's a temporary

1823
01:38:58,400 --> 01:39:04,719
help. You must not depend on it because

1824
01:39:02,080 --> 01:39:07,920
if you depend on it,

1825
01:39:04,719 --> 01:39:10,000
it will cease to work because

1826
01:39:07,920 --> 01:39:12,639
you will be

1827
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:15,360
not be able to create the mechanism, the

1828
01:39:12,639 --> 01:39:18,239
natural organic mechanism to do it

1829
01:39:15,360 --> 01:39:21,360
yourself. And that's what is important.

1830
01:39:18,239 --> 01:39:25,280
That's um psychedelics gives an a

1831
01:39:21,360 --> 01:39:27,760
temporary illusurary feeling of getting

1832
01:39:25,280 --> 01:39:29,679
somewhere but it's not the real thing.

1833
01:39:27,760 --> 01:39:32,000
The real thing is without alcohol,

1834
01:39:29,679 --> 01:39:37,119
without psychedelics, that's the real

1835
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:39,280
thing. You do the job, you know. Um,

1836
01:39:37,119 --> 01:39:41,440
and you know, psychedelics, it depends

1837
01:39:39,280 --> 01:39:45,360
on substances. Block it. block the

1838
01:39:41,440 --> 01:39:49,360
process because it creates it produce

1839
01:39:45,360 --> 01:39:51,600
pro products um produces chemicals in

1840
01:39:49,360 --> 01:39:54,480
the brain that are going to create an

1841
01:39:51,600 --> 01:39:57,840
imbalance and this imbalance is going to

1842
01:39:54,480 --> 01:40:00,719
stop you to be get in the way of you

1843
01:39:57,840 --> 01:40:02,639
connecting to your higher self.

1844
01:40:00,719 --> 01:40:07,040
So

1845
01:40:02,639 --> 01:40:10,639
I would not use psychedelics.

1846
01:40:07,040 --> 01:40:15,199
I'll try it without it. Um, and see how

1847
01:40:10,639 --> 01:40:18,480
it goes. I hope it works.

1848
01:40:15,199 --> 01:40:23,600
It It will.

1849
01:40:18,480 --> 01:40:27,560
It will. I'm sure. I know it works. Um,

1850
01:40:23,600 --> 01:40:27,560
question by

1851
01:40:27,600 --> 01:40:33,639
Kevin Glauses Dershire, England.

1852
01:40:33,679 --> 01:40:38,239
Hi David. Thank you, sweet Elena, and

1853
01:40:36,239 --> 01:40:42,840
your crew up,

1854
01:40:38,239 --> 01:40:42,840
down, and on middle stairs.

1855
01:40:43,280 --> 01:40:48,000
I have discovered and read about the

1856
01:40:45,199 --> 01:40:52,239
evil horrors of things on terror,

1857
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:56,159
particularly about children. Ah, yeah. I

1858
01:40:52,239 --> 01:40:58,639
am 71 years old and father and

1859
01:40:56,159 --> 01:41:00,719
grandfather to my family. I never

1860
01:40:58,639 --> 01:41:03,360
thought at my age I would have real

1861
01:41:00,719 --> 01:41:08,000
tears rolling down my cheeks and this

1862
01:41:03,360 --> 01:41:10,000
terrible ache within my gut.

1863
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:11,679
This part of my awakening is not

1864
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:14,800
pleasant.

1865
01:41:11,679 --> 01:41:17,600
I know the psychopathic perpetrators

1866
01:41:14,800 --> 01:41:20,960
when they pass on naturally or not, how

1867
01:41:17,600 --> 01:41:24,000
is their soul dealt with

1868
01:41:20,960 --> 01:41:26,239
assuming they actually have one?

1869
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:29,520
who processes them and who ships them

1870
01:41:26,239 --> 01:41:32,400
off to whatever prison planet. Clearly,

1871
01:41:29,520 --> 01:41:34,800
they cannot come back to terror such as

1872
01:41:32,400 --> 01:41:38,239
KS

1873
01:41:34,800 --> 01:41:39,920
where they this evil in their previous

1874
01:41:38,239 --> 01:41:43,440
life.

1875
01:41:39,920 --> 01:41:46,960
Love to you all. Hi to sweet Danny. I

1876
01:41:43,440 --> 01:41:48,480
call her Danny Dark.

1877
01:41:46,960 --> 01:41:51,280
Wow, Denny, I hope you're here and

1878
01:41:48,480 --> 01:41:54,239
you're hearing this.

1879
01:41:51,280 --> 01:41:57,040
Love to you, uh, sweet Denny. I'm sure

1880
01:41:54,239 --> 01:42:00,040
she's listening. I am sure, too, she's

1881
01:41:57,040 --> 01:42:00,040
listening.

1882
01:42:00,960 --> 01:42:05,920
Um, I just saw your message, Tina, in

1883
01:42:04,239 --> 01:42:09,199
the chat.

1884
01:42:05,920 --> 01:42:11,760
Okay. Um, so I'm going to display your

1885
01:42:09,199 --> 01:42:16,199
message, Kevin,

1886
01:42:11,760 --> 01:42:16,199
and take the points in it.

1887
01:42:16,880 --> 01:42:19,880
Yes,

1888
01:42:20,560 --> 01:42:28,000
you have two types of [ __ ] Um,

1889
01:42:25,360 --> 01:42:31,600
you have people who are neutral like

1890
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:37,360
every one of us and in some lives choose

1891
01:42:31,600 --> 01:42:39,600
to experience being a nasty thing.

1892
01:42:37,360 --> 01:42:43,040
Before they may have been good and after

1893
01:42:39,600 --> 01:42:46,560
maybe they they will work on repenting

1894
01:42:43,040 --> 01:42:49,679
themselves and you know amending themsel

1895
01:42:46,560 --> 01:42:52,159
mending themselves.

1896
01:42:49,679 --> 01:42:54,719
These ones their

1897
01:42:52,159 --> 01:42:57,440
sentence they do it themselves. It's

1898
01:42:54,719 --> 01:43:00,400
called karma. And karma

1899
01:42:57,440 --> 01:43:02,639
you make it yourself because when you

1900
01:43:00,400 --> 01:43:05,360
leave this body and you go back to the

1901
01:43:02,639 --> 01:43:07,600
atheric plains you you decide what

1902
01:43:05,360 --> 01:43:09,840
you're going to do next.

1903
01:43:07,600 --> 01:43:12,480
And because you know your you see the

1904
01:43:09,840 --> 01:43:16,960
greater perspective and the the purpose

1905
01:43:12,480 --> 01:43:20,560
of your existence as a soul eternal soul

1906
01:43:16,960 --> 01:43:22,960
is to learn you're going to now then

1907
01:43:20,560 --> 01:43:27,199
rebalance in the next life your mistakes

1908
01:43:22,960 --> 01:43:31,119
and repair them. And that's called

1909
01:43:27,199 --> 01:43:34,320
karma. I did um a little video on karma.

1910
01:43:31,119 --> 01:43:37,040
I said um we say karma is the bit is a

1911
01:43:34,320 --> 01:43:38,480
beach and the beach is you because you

1912
01:43:37,040 --> 01:43:40,960
decide for yourself what you're going to

1913
01:43:38,480 --> 01:43:44,639
do because you see it of a greater

1914
01:43:40,960 --> 01:43:48,480
perspective. So that concerns the the

1915
01:43:44,639 --> 01:43:51,280
the souls who are like everyone most of

1916
01:43:48,480 --> 01:43:52,639
the souls on their journey experience

1917
01:43:51,280 --> 01:43:55,639
different things. Okay, that's one

1918
01:43:52,639 --> 01:43:55,639
thing.

1919
01:43:56,320 --> 01:44:02,639
These souls

1920
01:43:59,360 --> 01:44:05,520
in one of their lives experiencing being

1921
01:44:02,639 --> 01:44:09,199
evil,

1922
01:44:05,520 --> 01:44:11,440
they must not go too far in evil.

1923
01:44:09,199 --> 01:44:13,920
Because if they go too far, they sink

1924
01:44:11,440 --> 01:44:16,320
into it and they entangle with it and

1925
01:44:13,920 --> 01:44:22,080
they become they pass to the dark side

1926
01:44:16,320 --> 01:44:25,040
of the force and they then serve the

1927
01:44:22,080 --> 01:44:27,840
destructive aspect of source. You know

1928
01:44:25,040 --> 01:44:30,239
source has two aspect like a breathing

1929
01:44:27,840 --> 01:44:34,159
creation destruction and the fight

1930
01:44:30,239 --> 01:44:36,560
between both with creation always above

1931
01:44:34,159 --> 01:44:39,360
is what makes the engine of the universe

1932
01:44:36,560 --> 01:44:42,560
go creation go. So if you go too far

1933
01:44:39,360 --> 01:44:46,239
into the evilness, you will sink into

1934
01:44:42,560 --> 01:44:48,880
the destruction side.

1935
01:44:46,239 --> 01:44:52,400
And to get out of there,

1936
01:44:48,880 --> 01:44:54,719
good luck. But it's possible.

1937
01:44:52,400 --> 01:44:59,199
Well, that's this. Then you have the

1938
01:44:54,719 --> 01:45:01,360
soul. So from the start have decided

1939
01:44:59,199 --> 01:45:03,760
to be evil,

1940
01:45:01,360 --> 01:45:06,480
to serve the destructive

1941
01:45:03,760 --> 01:45:08,080
aspect of source, but really in a bad

1942
01:45:06,480 --> 01:45:11,199
way.

1943
01:45:08,080 --> 01:45:15,440
and enjoy it.

1944
01:45:11,199 --> 01:45:18,159
So these ones, these ones they will make

1945
01:45:15,440 --> 01:45:21,119
their way as evilness but when they will

1946
01:45:18,159 --> 01:45:26,040
reach the higher densities

1947
01:45:21,119 --> 01:45:26,040
this will start to temper

1948
01:45:26,560 --> 01:45:31,920
and they will as they approach source

1949
01:45:28,960 --> 01:45:34,080
the evilness will will disappear

1950
01:45:31,920 --> 01:45:37,520
on in the cycles of reincarnation I'm

1951
01:45:34,080 --> 01:45:39,280
talking and then arrive to source they

1952
01:45:37,520 --> 01:45:41,600
won't be evil anymore they will be

1953
01:45:39,280 --> 01:45:41,600
neutral

1954
01:45:42,639 --> 01:45:47,600
But right after they die, that's what

1955
01:45:45,679 --> 01:45:50,000
your question, right? Right after they

1956
01:45:47,600 --> 01:45:53,760
die,

1957
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:57,119
these evil ones are going to reincarnate

1958
01:45:53,760 --> 01:45:58,880
in the evil side

1959
01:45:57,119 --> 01:46:00,880
because that's the the path they've

1960
01:45:58,880 --> 01:46:03,199
chosen.

1961
01:46:00,880 --> 01:46:07,440
So there are two types, you know, two

1962
01:46:03,199 --> 01:46:09,280
types. Two types. Um, usually when you

1963
01:46:07,440 --> 01:46:14,159
are that evil and serving the the the

1964
01:46:09,280 --> 01:46:16,560
the regressive part of aspect of source,

1965
01:46:14,159 --> 01:46:19,040
you have more easiness to be incarnated

1966
01:46:16,560 --> 01:46:23,280
in races such as the alpha draconian

1967
01:46:19,040 --> 01:46:26,159
sears or the mitra races that allow to

1968
01:46:23,280 --> 01:46:29,280
support these cycles cycles of evil

1969
01:46:26,159 --> 01:46:33,119
reincarnations, you know, evilness. In

1970
01:46:29,280 --> 01:46:37,280
humans, it's more the free u free will

1971
01:46:33,119 --> 01:46:40,239
and uh the karmic depth.

1972
01:46:37,280 --> 01:46:42,560
It's different. It's different.

1973
01:46:40,239 --> 01:46:44,800
And if human really go bad, you know,

1974
01:46:42,560 --> 01:46:47,679
they sink into the dark side of the

1975
01:46:44,800 --> 01:46:52,199
force. So, um

1976
01:46:47,679 --> 01:46:52,199
I hope it answers your question.

1977
01:46:54,159 --> 01:46:59,600
The universe doesn't punish you. Punish

1978
01:46:56,400 --> 01:47:02,639
yourself. you I mean it's not that you

1979
01:46:59,600 --> 01:47:04,320
punish yourself. You you make justice

1980
01:47:02,639 --> 01:47:06,639
yourself for your actions. You take

1981
01:47:04,320 --> 01:47:10,920
responsibility of your actions. That's

1982
01:47:06,639 --> 01:47:10,920
how you punish yourself.

1983
01:47:14,960 --> 01:47:22,000
Now a question from Gorana Turkis.

1984
01:47:18,639 --> 01:47:25,600
Hello dearas. So, do different avatar

1985
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:28,480
bodies that a soul group

1986
01:47:25,600 --> 01:47:30,880
through have some physical similarities?

1987
01:47:28,480 --> 01:47:33,520
For example, I color or face features or

1988
01:47:30,880 --> 01:47:35,040
something else. My heart goes to you in

1989
01:47:33,520 --> 01:47:36,960
gratitude for all the precious

1990
01:47:35,040 --> 01:47:38,800
information that you bring us. Thank

1991
01:47:36,960 --> 01:47:41,760
you, Gorana.

1992
01:47:38,800 --> 01:47:43,920
Um, thank you so much. Do different

1993
01:47:41,760 --> 01:47:47,880
avatar bodies that a soul goes through

1994
01:47:43,920 --> 01:47:47,880
have some physical similarities?

1995
01:47:48,159 --> 01:47:53,560
Yes.

1996
01:47:50,560 --> 01:47:53,560
Yes.

1997
01:47:53,760 --> 01:47:59,520
That's a point I haven't touched yet and

1998
01:47:57,040 --> 01:48:02,920
it's very important.

1999
01:47:59,520 --> 01:48:02,920
Thank you, Gorana.

2000
01:48:05,520 --> 01:48:09,840
When you start your cycles of

2001
01:48:07,440 --> 01:48:13,520
incarnation on a planet, your new home

2002
01:48:09,840 --> 01:48:16,400
world, you will grow into something.

2003
01:48:13,520 --> 01:48:20,320
And this something will take shape

2004
01:48:16,400 --> 01:48:24,639
slowly slowly and end up to end up being

2005
01:48:20,320 --> 01:48:28,000
shaped as to fit the most evolved

2006
01:48:24,639 --> 01:48:30,000
species on your planet.

2007
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:35,800
That's what that will be the shape of

2008
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:35,800
your your your soul. Okay,

2009
01:48:38,159 --> 01:48:43,520
your light being

2010
01:48:41,520 --> 01:48:45,840
you need there's a slight difference

2011
01:48:43,520 --> 01:48:47,520
between light being or soul and

2012
01:48:45,840 --> 01:48:50,639
consciousness. Consciousness is the

2013
01:48:47,520 --> 01:48:53,520
awareness is the sentience,

2014
01:48:50,639 --> 01:48:57,920
the intelligence, the awareness and the

2015
01:48:53,520 --> 01:49:01,600
the isbe or or soul body or light body

2016
01:48:57,920 --> 01:49:04,719
is the light being is the etheric body.

2017
01:49:01,600 --> 01:49:08,639
And this etheric body

2018
01:49:04,719 --> 01:49:11,440
that carries is a carrier carrier uh of

2019
01:49:08,639 --> 01:49:16,000
the the consciousness

2020
01:49:11,440 --> 01:49:18,239
has a shape has been shaped. So if you

2021
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:23,760
the the most evolved species on your

2022
01:49:18,239 --> 01:49:26,719
planet is fat of genetically big

2023
01:49:23,760 --> 01:49:30,480
well that will be the shape final shape

2024
01:49:26,719 --> 01:49:33,360
of your light being of

2025
01:49:30,480 --> 01:49:37,920
so the will not be able to reincarnate

2026
01:49:33,360 --> 01:49:39,520
in tiny bodies because it will suffer

2027
01:49:37,920 --> 01:49:41,119
and

2028
01:49:39,520 --> 01:49:44,480
same

2029
01:49:41,119 --> 01:49:48,239
contrary. So you have some features and

2030
01:49:44,480 --> 01:49:53,440
you will always um reincarnate in bodies

2031
01:49:48,239 --> 01:49:56,000
that fit harmoniously your

2032
01:49:53,440 --> 01:50:00,400
so yeah

2033
01:49:56,000 --> 01:50:03,400
that's um that can help.

2034
01:50:00,400 --> 01:50:03,400
Um

2035
01:50:03,440 --> 01:50:06,719
thank you Gorana. Thank you. Thank you.

2036
01:50:05,199 --> 01:50:09,280
That was a great question because it

2037
01:50:06,719 --> 01:50:12,280
allowed me to say that. Very good. Very

2038
01:50:09,280 --> 01:50:12,280
good.

2039
01:50:15,920 --> 01:50:20,880
Question by Zach Jackie. Dear Selena,

2040
01:50:19,440 --> 01:50:23,679
can you please speak about the

2041
01:50:20,880 --> 01:50:26,639
consciousness being that incarnate in

2042
01:50:23,679 --> 01:50:28,239
domestic cat avatars?

2043
01:50:26,639 --> 01:50:30,000
There is something extremely special

2044
01:50:28,239 --> 01:50:32,159
about these beings. Thank you for all

2045
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:35,560
your patience with us and the guidance

2046
01:50:32,159 --> 01:50:35,560
you provide.

2047
01:50:38,800 --> 01:50:45,600
The genetics of cats

2048
01:50:42,400 --> 01:50:49,520
is a compound.

2049
01:50:45,600 --> 01:50:51,520
It's a compound of different

2050
01:50:49,520 --> 01:50:54,520
um

2051
01:50:51,520 --> 01:50:54,520
species.

2052
01:50:54,560 --> 01:51:03,920
Have you noticed how

2053
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:07,840
all the fines on earth have round pupils

2054
01:51:03,920 --> 01:51:10,320
and cats have slated pupil pupils? for

2055
01:51:07,840 --> 01:51:12,800
instance and they have other

2056
01:51:10,320 --> 01:51:17,199
characteristics that are proper to them

2057
01:51:12,800 --> 01:51:18,960
and not found in other fine on earth.

2058
01:51:17,199 --> 01:51:22,239
It's because they carry different

2059
01:51:18,960 --> 01:51:25,520
genetics and they have a multi-frequency

2060
01:51:22,239 --> 01:51:29,080
key. They are multi-

2061
01:51:25,520 --> 01:51:29,080
density consciousness

2062
01:51:29,920 --> 01:51:39,040
that allows souls from

2063
01:51:33,840 --> 01:51:43,040
higher density to incarnate in them.

2064
01:51:39,040 --> 01:51:46,239
That's why cats are so in so so special

2065
01:51:43,040 --> 01:51:49,040
and can really connect

2066
01:51:46,239 --> 01:51:52,360
see things that we don't see. They seen

2067
01:51:49,040 --> 01:51:52,360
other danc

2068
01:51:56,080 --> 01:52:03,520
alien DNA. They are um failines from

2069
01:51:59,679 --> 01:52:06,480
Earth but mixed with other DNAs.

2070
01:52:03,520 --> 01:52:09,199
They were a wonderful experiment and um

2071
01:52:06,480 --> 01:52:13,840
they are able to

2072
01:52:09,199 --> 01:52:16,840
to receive very wise and evolved

2073
01:52:13,840 --> 01:52:16,840
beings.

2074
01:52:18,320 --> 01:52:26,760
So, um, Egyptians knew that and other,

2075
01:52:22,480 --> 01:52:26,760
um, cultures.

2076
01:52:29,440 --> 01:52:34,000
Katy, is Earth the only planet where

2077
01:52:32,400 --> 01:52:35,599
people lose their memories before

2078
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:38,719
incarnating?

2079
01:52:35,599 --> 01:52:41,040
No. No. I think I um answered this

2080
01:52:38,719 --> 01:52:44,880
before. No, no, no. It's a normal

2081
01:52:41,040 --> 01:52:50,000
process. Uh, so I answered this question

2082
01:52:44,880 --> 01:52:53,920
before. So um sorry for that

2083
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:56,480
question by Frederick Wood.

2084
01:52:53,920 --> 01:52:59,599
Hi Frederick. Dear Alena, we realize

2085
01:52:56,480 --> 01:53:03,199
that you cannot say exactly when this

2086
01:52:59,599 --> 01:53:06,000
closure will occur because I don't have

2087
01:53:03,199 --> 01:53:11,040
the exact date. I'm going to talk about

2088
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:13,119
that. However, can you a who tell us if

2089
01:53:11,040 --> 01:53:15,119
there is a low, medium or high

2090
01:53:13,119 --> 01:53:18,000
probability that disclosure will occur

2091
01:53:15,119 --> 01:53:20,080
in 2024?

2092
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:22,560
um

2093
01:53:20,080 --> 01:53:25,199
medium

2094
01:53:22,560 --> 01:53:29,040
B help us understand that specifically

2095
01:53:25,199 --> 01:53:32,400
is holding up or blocking disclosure

2096
01:53:29,040 --> 01:53:36,239
while the governments the CIA the NSA

2097
01:53:32,400 --> 01:53:37,840
and all the the the

2098
01:53:36,239 --> 01:53:41,760
deep state in the government who don't

2099
01:53:37,840 --> 01:53:44,000
want disclosure to happen you know

2100
01:53:41,760 --> 01:53:46,560
um

2101
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:49,679
C suggests some concrete steps we can

2102
01:53:46,560 --> 01:53:52,239
take to speed up this process. Yes. Um

2103
01:53:49,679 --> 01:53:56,800
stop complying to fear narratives. Uh

2104
01:53:52,239 --> 01:53:58,639
stop um fighting each other. Work

2105
01:53:56,800 --> 01:54:03,320
together.

2106
01:53:58,639 --> 01:54:03,320
Unite. Unite in common causes

2107
01:54:03,440 --> 01:54:11,119
and stop complying to everything that is

2108
01:54:08,400 --> 01:54:14,080
sent at you by fear, trying to

2109
01:54:11,119 --> 01:54:18,239
manipulate you by fear.

2110
01:54:14,080 --> 01:54:22,239
And then disclosure can happen faster

2111
01:54:18,239 --> 01:54:24,719
because you will have stood up for

2112
01:54:22,239 --> 01:54:27,360
who who you are

2113
01:54:24,719 --> 01:54:30,639
and concretely also

2114
01:54:27,360 --> 01:54:35,880
well if you have so many people have

2115
01:54:30,639 --> 01:54:35,880
witnessed filmed photographed UFOs

2116
01:54:36,159 --> 01:54:42,880
don't wait to go to be heard by the

2117
01:54:40,080 --> 01:54:46,239
congress or whatever

2118
01:54:42,880 --> 01:54:48,320
put it on internet

2119
01:54:46,239 --> 01:54:51,679
speak out

2120
01:54:48,320 --> 01:54:54,239
without the need of everyone.

2121
01:54:51,679 --> 01:54:56,159
That's what you must do. All the

2122
01:54:54,239 --> 01:54:57,679
testimonies of people have been

2123
01:54:56,159 --> 01:55:00,719
abducted.

2124
01:54:57,679 --> 01:55:02,320
Get your story out in a way or the

2125
01:55:00,719 --> 01:55:05,440
other.

2126
01:55:02,320 --> 01:55:08,800
The more testimonies we have, the faster

2127
01:55:05,440 --> 01:55:11,679
we will go to the disclosure,

2128
01:55:08,800 --> 01:55:15,199
the doors open from the government side.

2129
01:55:11,679 --> 01:55:17,760
Okay? because it's a people who will

2130
01:55:15,199 --> 01:55:20,400
help, not the government. There is a

2131
01:55:17,760 --> 01:55:22,320
plan for disclosure that is in the hands

2132
01:55:20,400 --> 01:55:25,360
of the White Hats, the Earth Alliance,

2133
01:55:22,320 --> 01:55:28,239
and it is going well. Even if it doesn't

2134
01:55:25,360 --> 01:55:31,920
seem so, it's going well. But if you

2135
01:55:28,239 --> 01:55:35,080
want to help get your information out, I

2136
01:55:31,920 --> 01:55:35,080
would say

2137
01:55:38,239 --> 01:55:44,320
another question. Okay,

2138
01:55:41,599 --> 01:55:49,360
sorry. Don't answering talking about

2139
01:55:44,320 --> 01:55:52,480
cats. Oops, that was a cat

2140
01:55:49,360 --> 01:55:57,840
question. Oh, Mo. Oh my goodness, you're

2141
01:55:52,480 --> 01:55:59,920
here. Love you so much. Oh. Oh my

2142
01:55:57,840 --> 01:56:03,440
goodness. You must have been exhausted

2143
01:55:59,920 --> 01:56:06,400
organizing this conference. It's been

2144
01:56:03,440 --> 01:56:08,639
such a success. Oh my goodness. Dear

2145
01:56:06,400 --> 01:56:10,719
beautiful Elena, thank you for your

2146
01:56:08,639 --> 01:56:14,159
webinar. I have questions about soul

2147
01:56:10,719 --> 01:56:16,480
group. Once you incarnate, you usually

2148
01:56:14,159 --> 01:56:18,239
have deep relationships with others and

2149
01:56:16,480 --> 01:56:20,000
that is considered to be your soul

2150
01:56:18,239 --> 01:56:22,880
group.

2151
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:26,719
In your next lifetime, these group tend

2152
01:56:22,880 --> 01:56:29,119
to reincarnate or cooperate together.

2153
01:56:26,719 --> 01:56:31,520
Will it be possible for us humans to

2154
01:56:29,119 --> 01:56:33,599
become extraterrestrials in our next

2155
01:56:31,520 --> 01:56:38,440
incarnation? And what happens to the

2156
01:56:33,599 --> 01:56:38,440
soul group? Thank you very much, Miu.

2157
01:56:40,480 --> 01:56:49,440
Yes, if you have completed your um

2158
01:56:46,800 --> 01:56:51,440
your cycles of incarnation as a human,

2159
01:56:49,440 --> 01:56:55,920
not completed

2160
01:56:51,440 --> 01:56:57,520
that takes time. We I suppose very few

2161
01:56:55,920 --> 01:57:00,080
of us are at their last human

2162
01:56:57,520 --> 01:57:03,119
incarnation here. We still have so much

2163
01:57:00,080 --> 01:57:05,760
to learn. But if you have reached a

2164
01:57:03,119 --> 01:57:08,239
certain level of awareness of

2165
01:57:05,760 --> 01:57:12,719
development of consciousness, of course,

2166
01:57:08,239 --> 01:57:15,360
when you decorate, you can choose to

2167
01:57:12,719 --> 01:57:19,280
incarnate on other planets. And usually

2168
01:57:15,360 --> 01:57:23,760
you know how you know you're ready. It's

2169
01:57:19,280 --> 01:57:26,719
because you are thinking about it.

2170
01:57:23,760 --> 01:57:28,560
You know it is a possibility. Your soul,

2171
01:57:26,719 --> 01:57:32,000
your consciousness knows it is a

2172
01:57:28,560 --> 01:57:35,440
possibility. That's why you

2173
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:38,440
envision it.

2174
01:57:35,440 --> 01:57:38,440
Um

2175
01:57:40,239 --> 01:57:46,560
so um and your soul group your soul

2176
01:57:43,199 --> 01:57:48,560
group um

2177
01:57:46,560 --> 01:57:51,920
because you entangled to them they will

2178
01:57:48,560 --> 01:57:53,920
follow. Some maybe are not ready so they

2179
01:57:51,920 --> 01:57:56,480
will stay on the home world but you will

2180
01:57:53,920 --> 01:58:00,159
still be entangled

2181
01:57:56,480 --> 01:58:02,480
by thought with them and by heart.

2182
01:58:00,159 --> 01:58:07,679
So many people

2183
01:58:02,480 --> 01:58:11,040
feel as a star seeds that they are um

2184
01:58:07,679 --> 01:58:14,000
missing someone who is on another planet

2185
01:58:11,040 --> 01:58:17,040
or have family there.

2186
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:19,599
You know, children, husband, wife,

2187
01:58:17,040 --> 01:58:21,440
parents.

2188
01:58:19,599 --> 01:58:24,000
Maybe these people are not ready to go

2189
01:58:21,440 --> 01:58:28,239
yet. They have still a few incarnations

2190
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:30,560
to do. But you been fast. So sometimes

2191
01:58:28,239 --> 01:58:32,639
you you feel lonely or your family is

2192
01:58:30,560 --> 01:58:34,400
somewhere else that this is what about

2193
01:58:32,639 --> 01:58:36,560
you still keep the entanglement you

2194
01:58:34,400 --> 01:58:39,199
still keep it and usually you have

2195
01:58:36,560 --> 01:58:43,840
tendency to incarnate same place when

2196
01:58:39,199 --> 01:58:47,280
you can you know it's it's it's better

2197
01:58:43,840 --> 01:58:49,599
it's normally the the choice. Thank you

2198
01:58:47,280 --> 01:58:53,440
for your question.

2199
01:58:49,599 --> 01:58:57,000
You are amazing. You are really amazing.

2200
01:58:53,440 --> 01:58:57,000
So, um,

2201
01:58:59,599 --> 01:59:03,880
I'll try to scroll down.

2202
01:59:04,560 --> 01:59:08,400
Yeah.

2203
01:59:06,320 --> 01:59:12,239
Um,

2204
01:59:08,400 --> 01:59:14,719
I'm going to bring some more tea.

2205
01:59:12,239 --> 01:59:19,480
You know, I've been a bit tired of with

2206
01:59:14,719 --> 01:59:19,480
all these um travels

2207
01:59:21,599 --> 01:59:27,560
and emotional

2208
01:59:23,920 --> 01:59:27,560
emotional challenges

2209
01:59:28,960 --> 01:59:32,199
on duty.

2210
01:59:32,800 --> 01:59:37,040
Hi Elena, can you please help separate

2211
01:59:34,719 --> 01:59:40,239
fact from fiction regarding the Apollo

2212
01:59:37,040 --> 01:59:42,320
missions? For example, Van Allen

2213
01:59:40,239 --> 01:59:44,480
radiation prevents human travel by

2214
01:59:42,320 --> 01:59:47,760
unprotected rocket ships, but

2215
01:59:44,480 --> 01:59:49,920
magnetically chilled saucers are good.

2216
01:59:47,760 --> 01:59:54,000
Um,

2217
01:59:49,920 --> 01:59:58,159
no. Uh the Van Halen radiation belt

2218
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:59,760
doesn't stop uh ships to go uh beyond

2219
01:59:58,159 --> 02:00:04,599
it.

2220
01:59:59,760 --> 02:00:04,599
Um rocket ships I mean

2221
02:00:04,880 --> 02:00:11,040
they many rocket ships have been on the

2222
02:00:07,360 --> 02:00:14,639
moon for instance. So um

2223
02:00:11,040 --> 02:00:18,080
I think it's more of a myth the van uh

2224
02:00:14,639 --> 02:00:20,320
belt stopping ships. uh it's to

2225
02:00:18,080 --> 02:00:23,760
influence people like you can't go out

2226
02:00:20,320 --> 02:00:27,360
of your your planet. Um I think uh I

2227
02:00:23,760 --> 02:00:30,239
believe I believe uh it's very possible

2228
02:00:27,360 --> 02:00:32,159
to uh go beyond it.

2229
02:00:30,239 --> 02:00:36,280
Thank you.

2230
02:00:32,159 --> 02:00:36,280
Next question by

2231
02:00:37,360 --> 02:00:44,239
um

2232
02:00:39,360 --> 02:00:46,800
oh Japanese scriptures 100 TV.

2233
02:00:44,239 --> 02:00:49,360
Dear Elena, do you know anything about

2234
02:00:46,800 --> 02:00:51,520
people with bipolar?

2235
02:00:49,360 --> 02:00:53,520
Why do they have this condition? Thank

2236
02:00:51,520 --> 02:00:55,599
you for all your work, Marico. Oh,

2237
02:00:53,520 --> 02:00:59,520
Marico.

2238
02:00:55,599 --> 02:01:01,920
Um, Marico. Um,

2239
02:00:59,520 --> 02:01:07,040
okay.

2240
02:01:01,920 --> 02:01:11,440
Bipolar. Um, I'm not very qualified in

2241
02:01:07,040 --> 02:01:14,000
um this type of domain.

2242
02:01:11,440 --> 02:01:18,000
I think there must be two causes. the

2243
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:20,800
cause, a psychological cause. Sometimes

2244
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:22,719
also you can have two souls. Well, one

2245
02:01:20,800 --> 02:01:25,840
soul. There's always one soul in a body

2246
02:01:22,719 --> 02:01:27,360
and a second that is attached. That may

2247
02:01:25,840 --> 02:01:30,320
happen.

2248
02:01:27,360 --> 02:01:34,000
You have a soul wants to come with you

2249
02:01:30,320 --> 02:01:35,520
or wanted this body but was not allowed

2250
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:37,679
or

2251
02:01:35,520 --> 02:01:41,920
something like this and they are here

2252
02:01:37,679 --> 02:01:44,960
and they influence you, they attach you.

2253
02:01:41,920 --> 02:01:47,199
So suddenly you change but that's more

2254
02:01:44,960 --> 02:01:52,719
rare. I think it's more of an imbalance

2255
02:01:47,199 --> 02:01:56,159
in in the in the brain also. Um

2256
02:01:52,719 --> 02:01:59,520
I'm not very qualified. So I rather stay

2257
02:01:56,159 --> 02:02:02,000
here like this and not say more because

2258
02:01:59,520 --> 02:02:05,639
uh I'm not sure. I'm not sure. That's

2259
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:05,639
all I can say.

2260
02:02:06,159 --> 02:02:15,440
Thank you Marco.

2261
02:02:09,520 --> 02:02:19,280
Um, next question. Next question by

2262
02:02:15,440 --> 02:02:21,440
Edwin Kola. Hi Edwin. You have mentioned

2263
02:02:19,280 --> 02:02:23,679
that civilian contact will happen when

2264
02:02:21,440 --> 02:02:26,239
all the dangers are eradicated and after

2265
02:02:23,679 --> 02:02:28,080
the deep state collapses.

2266
02:02:26,239 --> 02:02:30,960
Will civilians learn about some

2267
02:02:28,080 --> 02:02:33,280
suppressed non-military off technologies

2268
02:02:30,960 --> 02:02:37,520
such as medbet before complete work

2269
02:02:33,280 --> 02:02:39,920
pieces reached? Yes. Oh yes. Yes.

2270
02:02:37,520 --> 02:02:43,360
This is and this has started that these

2271
02:02:39,920 --> 02:02:45,360
technologies are in the process of being

2272
02:02:43,360 --> 02:02:48,159
um disclosed and it's part of the the

2273
02:02:45,360 --> 02:02:51,199
helping people to to to take down the

2274
02:02:48,159 --> 02:02:54,159
deep state because they you know when

2275
02:02:51,199 --> 02:02:56,800
you know you have the knowledge it gives

2276
02:02:54,159 --> 02:02:59,520
you more courage and confidence to do

2277
02:02:56,800 --> 02:03:01,280
things you know to go for a while and to

2278
02:02:59,520 --> 02:03:03,599
fight when you know these technologies

2279
02:03:01,280 --> 02:03:05,599
are there. So yes disclosure is at two

2280
02:03:03,599 --> 02:03:07,760
speed you have the the disclosure where

2281
02:03:05,599 --> 02:03:09,520
these technologies

2282
02:03:07,760 --> 02:03:11,520
are

2283
02:03:09,520 --> 02:03:14,480
slowly slowly disclosed to people and

2284
02:03:11,520 --> 02:03:18,239
you have the extraterrestrial

2285
02:03:14,480 --> 02:03:21,360
um story that is also going to be

2286
02:03:18,239 --> 02:03:25,360
disclosed in the second time by

2287
02:03:21,360 --> 02:03:27,520
the white hats in the governments. So

2288
02:03:25,360 --> 02:03:31,599
yeah these two things yes of course this

2289
02:03:27,520 --> 02:03:36,119
technology will be available um not for

2290
02:03:31,599 --> 02:03:36,119
the medbed is difficult because

2291
02:03:37,840 --> 02:03:41,800
when you you you you

2292
02:03:42,400 --> 02:03:46,560
said the existence of these technologies

2293
02:03:44,239 --> 02:03:49,440
will be disclosed but regarding the

2294
02:03:46,560 --> 02:03:51,760
medbeds if you you supply a hospital

2295
02:03:49,440 --> 02:03:54,480
with medb beds the deep set will come

2296
02:03:51,760 --> 02:03:56,239
the following day and confiscate

2297
02:03:54,480 --> 02:03:59,040
everything.

2298
02:03:56,239 --> 02:04:02,719
So there's no point. So it needs we need

2299
02:03:59,040 --> 02:04:05,520
to go a little bit further in

2300
02:04:02,719 --> 02:04:07,679
getting the deep state to collapse

2301
02:04:05,520 --> 02:04:10,679
because we don't give them any power

2302
02:04:07,679 --> 02:04:10,679
anymore.

2303
02:04:11,199 --> 02:04:14,679
Here we go.

2304
02:04:16,639 --> 02:04:19,639
Um,

2305
02:04:21,599 --> 02:04:28,280
excuse me. I need some some tea because

2306
02:04:24,800 --> 02:04:28,280
I'm very tired.

2307
02:04:31,119 --> 02:04:34,119
Um,

2308
02:04:35,119 --> 02:04:39,440
we still have an hour ahead of us and I

2309
02:04:37,040 --> 02:04:41,440
want to do most more questions. Okay.

2310
02:04:39,440 --> 02:04:45,119
Dear Alena, thanks for bringing all this

2311
02:04:41,440 --> 02:04:49,679
knowledge. A question from my husband.

2312
02:04:45,119 --> 02:04:52,679
Um, oh, this question is from

2313
02:04:49,679 --> 02:04:52,679
Harumi.

2314
02:04:53,679 --> 02:04:59,119
Hi Harumi husband, how are you? Is there

2315
02:04:56,480 --> 02:05:02,320
a difference between soul and spirit?

2316
02:04:59,119 --> 02:05:04,239
Haha. It seems the soul repeats or seeks

2317
02:05:02,320 --> 02:05:06,960
the same experience while the spirit

2318
02:05:04,239 --> 02:05:09,440
looks for new experience. Do you have

2319
02:05:06,960 --> 02:05:11,679
any insight about this? Sending you much

2320
02:05:09,440 --> 02:05:14,679
love and gratitude for your continuous

2321
02:05:11,679 --> 02:05:14,679
work.

2322
02:05:15,040 --> 02:05:23,920
You have the isby which is your um your

2323
02:05:19,760 --> 02:05:28,639
being that includes the light body

2324
02:05:23,920 --> 02:05:31,639
that is shaped and the consciousness

2325
02:05:28,639 --> 02:05:31,639
slashspirit.

2326
02:05:32,880 --> 02:05:38,520
Two things are different although

2327
02:05:35,520 --> 02:05:38,520
entangled.

2328
02:05:42,320 --> 02:05:46,560
When you say soul repeats or seeks the

2329
02:05:44,800 --> 02:05:49,199
same experience while the spirit looks

2330
02:05:46,560 --> 02:05:51,520
for new experience,

2331
02:05:49,199 --> 02:05:56,119
it is two in one.

2332
02:05:51,520 --> 02:05:56,119
You will always um

2333
02:05:56,800 --> 02:06:04,960
look for new experience as part of your

2334
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:08,960
evolution, but at the same time, you

2335
02:06:04,960 --> 02:06:11,760
want to repair

2336
02:06:08,960 --> 02:06:13,199
the the the mistakes you've made in the

2337
02:06:11,760 --> 02:06:16,080
previous life. So, you are going to

2338
02:06:13,199 --> 02:06:18,320
repeat the situation to be able to

2339
02:06:16,080 --> 02:06:20,719
change the outcome.

2340
02:06:18,320 --> 02:06:24,679
So both

2341
02:06:20,719 --> 02:06:24,679
both at the same time

2342
02:06:32,880 --> 02:06:38,880
Danielle Kleti. Hello Danielle. Dear

2343
02:06:36,320 --> 02:06:41,679
Elena, as we are currently on earth

2344
02:06:38,880 --> 02:06:43,840
incarnated in a humanoid avatar, does it

2345
02:06:41,679 --> 02:06:46,079
mean that our soul is always

2346
02:06:43,840 --> 02:06:50,119
reincarnated in humanoid avatar? not

2347
02:06:46,079 --> 02:06:50,119
mercy port.

2348
02:06:51,280 --> 02:06:56,560
Oh yes, I covered this earlier on. So um

2349
02:06:54,159 --> 02:07:00,000
if you've made all your evolution as a

2350
02:06:56,560 --> 02:07:02,079
human, you will have a human structure.

2351
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:04,320
That's how you've developed into you

2352
02:07:02,079 --> 02:07:08,199
know so you cannot incarnate in

2353
02:07:04,320 --> 02:07:08,199
something too different.

2354
02:07:09,040 --> 02:07:15,360
Next question by Josephine. Hi

2355
02:07:12,320 --> 02:07:17,520
Josephine. Dear Elena, does the

2356
02:07:15,360 --> 02:07:19,679
liberation of the moon, Mars, and Saturn

2357
02:07:17,520 --> 02:07:22,480
modify the nature of their astrological

2358
02:07:19,679 --> 02:07:24,719
influence and in particular attenuate

2359
02:07:22,480 --> 02:07:28,639
the disharmonic impact they can have on

2360
02:07:24,719 --> 02:07:31,599
us? Gratitude globally, it won't modify

2361
02:07:28,639 --> 02:07:34,000
really the the the the astrological

2362
02:07:31,599 --> 02:07:38,079
influence of the planet which is due to

2363
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:40,400
a gravity pool. But ex effectively the

2364
02:07:38,079 --> 02:07:43,119
the the harmonics of the the frequencies

2365
02:07:40,400 --> 02:07:45,760
of the planet will have changed and so

2366
02:07:43,119 --> 02:07:49,440
it will influence play differently in

2367
02:07:45,760 --> 02:07:53,760
the influence of the astrology of this

2368
02:07:49,440 --> 02:07:57,599
planet. So um

2369
02:07:53,760 --> 02:08:01,000
I I I understand it like this.

2370
02:07:57,599 --> 02:08:01,000
Thank you Josephine.

2371
02:08:02,560 --> 02:08:08,400
Um, Arietta. Hey, Arietta.

2372
02:08:06,719 --> 02:08:11,040
I have to say the questions tonight,

2373
02:08:08,400 --> 02:08:12,639
they are really, really good. Really

2374
02:08:11,040 --> 02:08:15,520
good.

2375
02:08:12,639 --> 02:08:17,040
Hi, Elena. An entire awesome awesome

2376
02:08:15,520 --> 02:08:19,599
team.

2377
02:08:17,040 --> 02:08:23,119
Elena, before we decide to once again

2378
02:08:19,599 --> 02:08:26,639
incarnate into an avatar on planet

2379
02:08:23,119 --> 02:08:29,599
terror, do you have a choice as to the

2380
02:08:26,639 --> 02:08:32,639
gender we wish,

2381
02:08:29,599 --> 02:08:35,520
where we want to live, and who our

2382
02:08:32,639 --> 02:08:38,000
family of choices? Thank you, dear, for

2383
02:08:35,520 --> 02:08:40,000
our sweetest emissary, for your wisdom

2384
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:43,000
and hard work. Thank you very much,

2385
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:43,000
Enrieta.

2386
02:08:43,599 --> 02:08:49,599
Do we have the choice of gender we wish?

2387
02:08:45,840 --> 02:08:53,360
Yes, we do. Oh, many times we can want

2388
02:08:49,599 --> 02:08:56,159
to experience um different

2389
02:08:53,360 --> 02:09:02,719
gender because all is about the

2390
02:08:56,159 --> 02:09:04,320
experience. So often you end up uh in um

2391
02:09:02,719 --> 02:09:07,520
because you know you are going to grow

2392
02:09:04,320 --> 02:09:11,199
polarity. Um, consciousness is not

2393
02:09:07,520 --> 02:09:13,520
neutral at in its essence, but during

2394
02:09:11,199 --> 02:09:17,119
its development on the planet, it's

2395
02:09:13,520 --> 02:09:21,679
going to grow in a certain way

2396
02:09:17,119 --> 02:09:24,400
and be more and more drawn to a type of

2397
02:09:21,679 --> 02:09:27,840
polarity,

2398
02:09:24,400 --> 02:09:30,639
still allowed to incarnate at will in

2399
02:09:27,840 --> 02:09:34,480
different polarities.

2400
02:09:30,639 --> 02:09:36,719
But um so I know for myself as an

2401
02:09:34,480 --> 02:09:40,480
example I'm a feminine polarity as a

2402
02:09:36,719 --> 02:09:43,199
human alian but and I have incarnated in

2403
02:09:40,480 --> 02:09:47,199
men's body also to experience it but

2404
02:09:43,199 --> 02:09:50,400
when I was incarnated in man's body

2405
02:09:47,199 --> 02:09:53,040
I am sure I was gay

2406
02:09:50,400 --> 02:09:56,960
cuz I like men

2407
02:09:53,040 --> 02:10:01,040
I like males uh so when I was one male I

2408
02:09:56,960 --> 02:10:01,040
surely like males still I couldn't

2409
02:10:01,840 --> 02:10:07,040
envision it differently. So that's

2410
02:10:04,159 --> 02:10:10,079
interesting, isn't it?

2411
02:10:07,040 --> 02:10:16,280
So um

2412
02:10:10,079 --> 02:10:16,280
what other was in this question? Um

2413
02:10:16,320 --> 02:10:20,639
uh yes, we choose where we want to live.

2414
02:10:18,480 --> 02:10:24,560
We choose we choose uh oh yes, we

2415
02:10:20,639 --> 02:10:27,520
totally choose um

2416
02:10:24,560 --> 02:10:31,440
who our family of choice is.

2417
02:10:27,520 --> 02:10:35,679
That's bit more complex. Um

2418
02:10:31,440 --> 02:10:37,920
yes yes yes you can when you are from

2419
02:10:35,679 --> 02:10:39,760
the same when you are from the same

2420
02:10:37,920 --> 02:10:42,480
planetary matrix for instance an

2421
02:10:39,760 --> 02:10:45,760
earthlings hurtling doesn't need DNA

2422
02:10:42,480 --> 02:10:49,119
match with earth bodies. So earthling is

2423
02:10:45,760 --> 02:10:50,719
going to incarnate. Oh I like this

2424
02:10:49,119 --> 02:10:53,840
family because in this family I will

2425
02:10:50,719 --> 02:10:57,520
learn this. So he has a choice. But when

2426
02:10:53,840 --> 02:10:59,520
you are from outer space soul, you're

2427
02:10:57,520 --> 02:11:01,199
going to need certain DNA match. So

2428
02:10:59,520 --> 02:11:05,520
you're going to choose a human body of

2429
02:11:01,199 --> 02:11:09,599
Earth that has one of the 22

2430
02:11:05,520 --> 02:11:12,239
extraterrestrial DNA um

2431
02:11:09,599 --> 02:11:15,679
that matches yours.

2432
02:11:12,239 --> 02:11:18,320
So that's a bit different. So then

2433
02:11:15,679 --> 02:11:22,560
how do you see that you need help?

2434
02:11:18,320 --> 02:11:24,480
That's why there are envoy programs.

2435
02:11:22,560 --> 02:11:27,440
either you either you can determine it

2436
02:11:24,480 --> 02:11:30,639
by frequency or either uh most of the

2437
02:11:27,440 --> 02:11:34,079
time you require assistance uh from

2438
02:11:30,639 --> 02:11:38,159
technology from an envoy program that's

2439
02:11:34,079 --> 02:11:41,040
what I uh did when I came from era to

2440
02:11:38,159 --> 02:11:44,480
earth uh my previous incarnation was in

2441
02:11:41,040 --> 02:11:47,840
the pleades to earth I needed help from

2442
02:11:44,480 --> 02:11:50,239
uh uh technology and was there to

2443
02:11:47,840 --> 02:11:52,719
prepare for me a body on earth with the

2444
02:11:50,239 --> 02:11:56,239
right DNA this

2445
02:11:52,719 --> 02:12:01,280
uh to be able to receive my soul.

2446
02:11:56,239 --> 02:12:05,560
So So it depends. You see,

2447
02:12:01,280 --> 02:12:05,560
depends where you from.

2448
02:12:07,840 --> 02:12:13,840
Mark Davis. Hello Mark. Aloha Elena.

2449
02:12:10,639 --> 02:12:15,520
Does our soul play any part with our

2450
02:12:13,840 --> 02:12:19,480
dreams?

2451
02:12:15,520 --> 02:12:19,480
Mahalo Newi. Aloha.

2452
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:23,000
Um

2453
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:28,239
so yes that's interesting because yes in

2454
02:12:26,320 --> 02:12:30,560
your dreams

2455
02:12:28,239 --> 02:12:35,119
or dreams has have different levels as

2456
02:12:30,560 --> 02:12:37,920
you know dreams um

2457
02:12:35,119 --> 02:12:40,880
are sometimes just

2458
02:12:37,920 --> 02:12:45,119
um to release thoughts and emotions.

2459
02:12:40,880 --> 02:12:48,480
Some other dreams are to uh

2460
02:12:45,119 --> 02:12:50,239
astral about astral travels and

2461
02:12:48,480 --> 02:12:52,960
wandering through space and other

2462
02:12:50,239 --> 02:12:55,199
places. Quantum teleportation of your

2463
02:12:52,960 --> 02:12:56,960
consciousness. Uh I would say

2464
02:12:55,199 --> 02:13:00,560
consciousness projection would be the

2465
02:12:56,960 --> 02:13:03,760
the right word. Um

2466
02:13:00,560 --> 02:13:05,520
but you have also dreams with message

2467
02:13:03,760 --> 02:13:07,280
different type of stuff. And every time

2468
02:13:05,520 --> 02:13:11,199
it's your consciousness, it's your ease

2469
02:13:07,280 --> 02:13:13,760
be that is either going to astral travel

2470
02:13:11,199 --> 02:13:16,800
or either

2471
02:13:13,760 --> 02:13:20,000
interact with influences in your dreams.

2472
02:13:16,800 --> 02:13:22,239
Yes. Yes. The the consciousness of the

2473
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:25,119
and the be are playing a great role.

2474
02:13:22,239 --> 02:13:27,599
Consciousness on its in itself of course

2475
02:13:25,119 --> 02:13:29,440
and the be when it is about leaving the

2476
02:13:27,599 --> 02:13:31,599
body.

2477
02:13:29,440 --> 02:13:34,560
Something I haven't touched is the the

2478
02:13:31,599 --> 02:13:37,440
silver cord.

2479
02:13:34,560 --> 02:13:42,760
Ah, I have a good story

2480
02:13:37,440 --> 02:13:42,760
about that. I have a good story.

2481
02:13:43,040 --> 02:13:48,159
When you entangle from this, okay? But

2482
02:13:46,079 --> 02:13:51,360
you're going to match all the chakras

2483
02:13:48,159 --> 02:13:54,560
like keys like lock, lock, lock, lock,

2484
02:13:51,360 --> 02:13:56,800
lock. You're locked.

2485
02:13:54,560 --> 02:13:58,800
You're incarnated. You're stuck in

2486
02:13:56,800 --> 02:14:01,800
there.

2487
02:13:58,800 --> 02:14:01,800
Yes.

2488
02:14:02,880 --> 02:14:09,119
If you want to experience what we call

2489
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:12,800
astral travel, that means your ESB, your

2490
02:14:09,119 --> 02:14:15,679
body, light body, your ISB is going to

2491
02:14:12,800 --> 02:14:17,840
step outside of this this avatar

2492
02:14:15,679 --> 02:14:21,199
temporarily, but it will still be

2493
02:14:17,840 --> 02:14:24,239
attached to it, and tangled to it. And

2494
02:14:21,199 --> 02:14:26,400
as long as this avatar is alive,

2495
02:14:24,239 --> 02:14:30,079
okay? And as long as this avatar is

2496
02:14:26,400 --> 02:14:32,880
alive, there's there's a a kind of

2497
02:14:30,079 --> 02:14:36,239
umbilical cord, etheric umbilical cord

2498
02:14:32,880 --> 02:14:41,320
that links you um through the the plexus

2499
02:14:36,239 --> 02:14:41,320
to uh your isb

2500
02:14:41,360 --> 02:14:46,560
something went in my mind I say, "Oh, I

2501
02:14:43,920 --> 02:14:49,599
must not forget to say this."

2502
02:14:46,560 --> 02:14:53,719
Will come back.

2503
02:14:49,599 --> 02:14:53,719
Yes, that's is that's it.

2504
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:59,840
Where there's a pulse, there's life. A

2505
02:14:56,239 --> 02:15:02,560
pulse emits scalar waves.

2506
02:14:59,840 --> 02:15:04,800
The heartbeat. The heart is beating of

2507
02:15:02,560 --> 02:15:07,199
course to pump blood into the body, but

2508
02:15:04,800 --> 02:15:10,800
also the heart has an electromagnetic

2509
02:15:07,199 --> 02:15:13,599
field. Okay. It

2510
02:15:10,800 --> 02:15:15,440
and this electromagnetic field as a

2511
02:15:13,599 --> 02:15:19,520
pulse

2512
02:15:15,440 --> 02:15:21,920
and this pulse allows it's like an

2513
02:15:19,520 --> 02:15:24,960
electromagnetic field of a planet allows

2514
02:15:21,920 --> 02:15:26,400
life to come and entangle.

2515
02:15:24,960 --> 02:15:28,480
That's something I want to say. The

2516
02:15:26,400 --> 02:15:31,360
heartbeat when the heartbeat stops the

2517
02:15:28,480 --> 02:15:33,520
pulse ceases to exist and all the ties

2518
02:15:31,360 --> 02:15:36,800
plum plum plum plume unlock and you're

2519
02:15:33,520 --> 02:15:38,880
free to go. So my story I wanted to tell

2520
02:15:36,800 --> 02:15:42,960
you

2521
02:15:38,880 --> 02:15:45,360
one day um a Thoran told me for an

2522
02:15:42,960 --> 02:15:47,040
experiment. He said

2523
02:15:45,360 --> 02:15:49,119
I'm going to because I was asking him

2524
02:15:47,040 --> 02:15:53,440
questions about astral travel in these

2525
02:15:49,119 --> 02:15:55,599
bodies which u I didn't really know how

2526
02:15:53,440 --> 02:15:58,159
to experiment.

2527
02:15:55,599 --> 02:16:00,639
Um and he said to me okay let's try

2528
02:15:58,159 --> 02:16:03,199
something. This time you're coming with

2529
02:16:00,639 --> 02:16:07,119
me but I'm not going to teleport you.

2530
02:16:03,199 --> 02:16:10,400
you're going to come in an astral

2531
02:16:07,119 --> 02:16:14,960
uh projection and Oh, wow. Yeah, that's

2532
02:16:10,400 --> 02:16:19,119
going to be weird. So, he helped me get

2533
02:16:14,960 --> 02:16:20,719
my my ESB out of my body and I saw this

2534
02:16:19,119 --> 02:16:23,040
umbilical

2535
02:16:20,719 --> 02:16:27,840
thing floating

2536
02:16:23,040 --> 02:16:30,159
and um I was suddenly on board his ship

2537
02:16:27,840 --> 02:16:33,439
and there was still this this invisible

2538
02:16:30,159 --> 02:16:35,760
cord. Okay.

2539
02:16:33,439 --> 02:16:39,599
It was before the war in the star system

2540
02:16:35,760 --> 02:16:41,120
and it was more much more safer.

2541
02:16:39,599 --> 02:16:44,080
So he took me in this ship. So

2542
02:16:41,120 --> 02:16:48,800
mechanically my ESB was in this ship as

2543
02:16:44,080 --> 02:16:50,880
a translucent being. Okay. And I was

2544
02:16:48,800 --> 02:16:53,519
there conscious to be in the ship, not

2545
02:16:50,880 --> 02:16:55,920
anymore on Earth. And we flew. We flew.

2546
02:16:53,519 --> 02:16:59,120
We flew. When we arrived, we approached

2547
02:16:55,920 --> 02:17:01,760
the orbit of Pluto

2548
02:16:59,120 --> 02:17:03,599
means nearly at the edge of the inner

2549
02:17:01,760 --> 02:17:06,080
star system. But the inner star system

2550
02:17:03,599 --> 02:17:08,080
is within the asteroid. But I mean the

2551
02:17:06,080 --> 02:17:10,479
the first star system because there's

2552
02:17:08,080 --> 02:17:12,479
many layers.

2553
02:17:10,479 --> 02:17:15,599
When we arrive at the orbit of Pluto, I

2554
02:17:12,479 --> 02:17:18,800
start to feel not well. Like no, I want

2555
02:17:15,599 --> 02:17:21,359
to throw up. And I had vertigo. And Van

2556
02:17:18,800 --> 02:17:25,519
stopped the ship. He said, "No, this is

2557
02:17:21,359 --> 02:17:29,319
the limit. You cannot go further without

2558
02:17:25,519 --> 02:17:29,319
your physical body

2559
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:35,200
or either

2560
02:17:32,479 --> 02:17:38,160
you could do uh consciousness projection

2561
02:17:35,200 --> 02:17:41,120
that means the ESB is still in the body

2562
02:17:38,160 --> 02:17:44,399
but astral astral travel which mean the

2563
02:17:41,120 --> 02:17:47,599
ESB is out of the body because of this

2564
02:17:44,399 --> 02:17:50,319
silver cord

2565
02:17:47,599 --> 02:17:52,880
it's like an elastic is going to stretch

2566
02:17:50,319 --> 02:17:56,000
stretch until the moment

2567
02:17:52,880 --> 02:17:58,800
You stretch it too much, ping. It can

2568
02:17:56,000 --> 02:18:02,319
break. And if it breaks, the body that's

2569
02:17:58,800 --> 02:18:05,040
still on Earth dies of a heart attack.

2570
02:18:02,319 --> 02:18:06,719
The heart stops.

2571
02:18:05,040 --> 02:18:08,719
Okay?

2572
02:18:06,719 --> 02:18:12,479
And

2573
02:18:08,719 --> 02:18:14,399
you're kind of lost in space.

2574
02:18:12,479 --> 02:18:17,519
And it's very dangerous because if they

2575
02:18:14,399 --> 02:18:20,240
are predatory eteric uh beings they can

2576
02:18:17,519 --> 02:18:22,719
come and cut your

2577
02:18:20,240 --> 02:18:24,479
it's called you know so it's uh it's not

2578
02:18:22,719 --> 02:18:26,960
a good thing to do when you do astral

2579
02:18:24,479 --> 02:18:30,200
travel do it very wisely and don't go

2580
02:18:26,960 --> 02:18:30,200
too far

2581
02:18:31,200 --> 02:18:34,639
so that was it and then it brought me

2582
02:18:32,639 --> 02:18:36,880
back to earth and I was feeling better I

2583
02:18:34,639 --> 02:18:40,080
was getting closer to my body so um that

2584
02:18:36,880 --> 02:18:42,160
was very interesting thing that's why I

2585
02:18:40,080 --> 02:18:45,519
never do astral travel when I go stairs.

2586
02:18:42,160 --> 02:18:48,559
I'll always do teleportation. When I

2587
02:18:45,519 --> 02:18:50,880
want to visit other realms, I do

2588
02:18:48,559 --> 02:18:53,679
consciousness projection through my

2589
02:18:50,880 --> 02:18:56,960
pinal gland. But when I do that, my

2590
02:18:53,679 --> 02:19:00,240
consciousness extends and tangles to

2591
02:18:56,960 --> 02:19:03,040
some somewhere else, but everything

2592
02:19:00,240 --> 02:19:06,479
stays in the same place on earth.

2593
02:19:03,040 --> 02:19:08,319
The body is be and the anchor point of

2594
02:19:06,479 --> 02:19:11,519
consciousness. It's just an extension

2595
02:19:08,319 --> 02:19:14,160
that's going to uh wander a bit. That's

2596
02:19:11,519 --> 02:19:19,200
consciousness projection.

2597
02:19:14,160 --> 02:19:21,040
So, story stories. Next question.

2598
02:19:19,200 --> 02:19:22,960
Uh, Beia

2599
02:19:21,040 --> 02:19:24,880
and dear Elena, I've been reading that

2600
02:19:22,960 --> 02:19:27,200
according to the cedars and the nine,

2601
02:19:24,880 --> 02:19:29,120
earth is the only planet where you have

2602
02:19:27,200 --> 02:19:31,120
purely individual consciousness and

2603
02:19:29,120 --> 02:19:32,719
complete free will. Would you agree with

2604
02:19:31,120 --> 02:19:35,760
that? Thank you for being such an

2605
02:19:32,719 --> 02:19:40,519
inspiration to us.

2606
02:19:35,760 --> 02:19:40,519
Well, um, I don't agree.

2607
02:19:41,519 --> 02:19:47,120
Um, Earth is not the only planet where

2608
02:19:44,800 --> 02:19:51,600
you have purely individual consciousness

2609
02:19:47,120 --> 02:19:53,760
and complete free will. Um, it's two

2610
02:19:51,600 --> 02:19:55,600
different things. Okay, purely

2611
02:19:53,760 --> 02:19:57,920
individual consciousness, it's

2612
02:19:55,600 --> 02:20:01,200
individuated consciousness. though that

2613
02:19:57,920 --> 02:20:04,160
is found everywhere where in in the

2614
02:20:01,200 --> 02:20:07,040
universe even so many different species

2615
02:20:04,160 --> 02:20:09,439
um you know especially humans

2616
02:20:07,040 --> 02:20:11,920
uh complete free will is a natural state

2617
02:20:09,439 --> 02:20:14,000
of the universe

2618
02:20:11,920 --> 02:20:16,000
until grace or reptilians come and

2619
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:18,960
mingle with your free will and

2620
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:21,040
manipulate you to to get you to consent

2621
02:20:18,960 --> 02:20:23,040
to be enslaved

2622
02:20:21,040 --> 02:20:26,560
free will complete free will is the

2623
02:20:23,040 --> 02:20:29,560
natural nature of the universe

2624
02:20:26,560 --> 02:20:29,560
So,

2625
02:20:29,840 --> 02:20:33,319
there we go.

2626
02:20:33,520 --> 02:20:38,120
Question from Oops.

2627
02:20:38,800 --> 02:20:43,280
I have a new mouse that doesn't have the

2628
02:20:40,720 --> 02:20:45,280
scroll button, so I need to just click

2629
02:20:43,280 --> 02:20:48,880
on the thing on the side and it's sorry

2630
02:20:45,280 --> 02:20:53,920
for that. I lost mine in the plane and

2631
02:20:48,880 --> 02:20:57,359
so Okay. Um, question by

2632
02:20:53,920 --> 02:20:59,760
David Beville. Hi David, big question on

2633
02:20:57,359 --> 02:21:03,600
what source is like regarding duality.

2634
02:20:59,760 --> 02:21:05,920
Yes, duality. Okay, let's go with that.

2635
02:21:03,600 --> 02:21:09,200
I can understand

2636
02:21:05,920 --> 02:21:11,200
and accept a duality intrinsic to source

2637
02:21:09,200 --> 02:21:14,640
of many things such as creation and

2638
02:21:11,200 --> 02:21:18,960
destruction in some ways but hard to

2639
02:21:14,640 --> 02:21:20,960
accept love versus evil. Ah, it's not

2640
02:21:18,960 --> 02:21:23,439
exactly like this. Love is the the

2641
02:21:20,960 --> 02:21:27,439
frequency of source is a creative

2642
02:21:23,439 --> 02:21:32,240
frequency of source. Okay. It's not love

2643
02:21:27,439 --> 02:21:35,240
against evil, David. It's it's um how to

2644
02:21:32,240 --> 02:21:35,240
say

2645
02:21:37,840 --> 02:21:40,840
creation

2646
02:21:40,880 --> 02:21:49,439
against destruction. How what would I

2647
02:21:44,880 --> 02:21:53,120
oppose evil to?

2648
02:21:49,439 --> 02:21:55,439
It's a different type of um love. I

2649
02:21:53,120 --> 02:21:59,439
would say compassion, compassion,

2650
02:21:55,439 --> 02:22:02,160
compassion, the great word of compassion

2651
02:21:59,439 --> 02:22:06,080
to be differentiated from the frequency

2652
02:22:02,160 --> 02:22:08,479
of love which is a

2653
02:22:06,080 --> 02:22:11,280
mathematical scientific frequency

2654
02:22:08,479 --> 02:22:14,000
emitted by source.

2655
02:22:11,280 --> 02:22:16,319
Sorry.

2656
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:20,319
So um

2657
02:22:16,319 --> 02:22:23,120
I'd say I oppose evil to compassion, not

2658
02:22:20,319 --> 02:22:26,439
to love.

2659
02:22:23,120 --> 02:22:26,439
That's difference.

2660
02:22:28,399 --> 02:22:35,880
I got that in Dubai in the airport.

2661
02:22:31,840 --> 02:22:35,880
Okay. Um

2662
02:22:36,640 --> 02:22:42,479
I hope it helps helps David answer your

2663
02:22:40,160 --> 02:22:44,080
question.

2664
02:22:42,479 --> 02:22:45,600
These questions are great because you

2665
02:22:44,080 --> 02:22:48,560
ask a question for yourself but it

2666
02:22:45,600 --> 02:22:54,399
benefits everyone else is. Great.

2667
02:22:48,560 --> 02:22:56,720
Another question by um Sheree Garn.

2668
02:22:54,399 --> 02:22:59,760
Thank you Elena for your amazing service

2669
02:22:56,720 --> 02:23:01,840
to humanity. Thank you Sheri. Could you

2670
02:22:59,760 --> 02:23:05,520
please respond to the recent interview

2671
02:23:01,840 --> 02:23:08,000
by Dr. Salah of George Cavasalis.

2672
02:23:05,520 --> 02:23:12,880
I haven't watched it. I was traveling

2673
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:16,160
and I haven't watched it. So I cannot

2674
02:23:12,880 --> 02:23:20,720
say anything. I haven't watched it. So

2675
02:23:16,160 --> 02:23:22,960
um but what is in your question um uh

2676
02:23:20,720 --> 02:23:27,120
could you also please respond to what

2677
02:23:22,960 --> 02:23:29,359
Mr. Kvasalis has to say

2678
02:23:27,120 --> 02:23:31,520
about

2679
02:23:29,359 --> 02:23:34,720
where are you

2680
02:23:31,520 --> 02:23:37,040
the chakra condalini pinal system of

2681
02:23:34,720 --> 02:23:39,439
enlightenment where it came from and

2682
02:23:37,040 --> 02:23:41,520
what we gain access to when we achieve

2683
02:23:39,439 --> 02:23:45,520
full condalini awakening and activation

2684
02:23:41,520 --> 02:23:49,319
of the pinal gland. Thank you.

2685
02:23:45,520 --> 02:23:49,319
that I can talk about.

2686
02:23:52,720 --> 02:24:01,399
When you awaken

2687
02:23:57,200 --> 02:24:01,399
your fire

2688
02:24:04,640 --> 02:24:11,920
when you wake up, the two serpents that

2689
02:24:08,080 --> 02:24:14,319
are going to come and coil and activate.

2690
02:24:11,920 --> 02:24:17,040
And every time they cross, they cross at

2691
02:24:14,319 --> 02:24:21,120
a chakra intersection.

2692
02:24:17,040 --> 02:24:25,200
And you know you have not

2693
02:24:21,120 --> 02:24:28,600
seven chakra you have way more way more

2694
02:24:25,200 --> 02:24:28,600
seven key

2695
02:24:28,720 --> 02:24:32,040
seven portals

2696
02:24:32,800 --> 02:24:39,439
it's going to activate

2697
02:24:36,399 --> 02:24:42,880
by rebalancing the frequency each of the

2698
02:24:39,439 --> 02:24:46,640
chakras it goes up

2699
02:24:42,880 --> 02:24:49,280
and when it arrives in the pineal gland

2700
02:24:46,640 --> 02:24:51,120
The two serpents meet and it is the

2701
02:24:49,280 --> 02:24:52,880
alchemical

2702
02:24:51,120 --> 02:24:55,520
union

2703
02:24:52,880 --> 02:24:59,680
of the masculine and the feminine. The

2704
02:24:55,520 --> 02:25:02,000
red dragon is the feminine, the blood of

2705
02:24:59,680 --> 02:25:04,800
manstruation if you want to remember it.

2706
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:06,800
And the white dragon is the male energy,

2707
02:25:04,800 --> 02:25:09,280
the sperm if you want to remember it.

2708
02:25:06,800 --> 02:25:12,160
It's easy like this. The white and the

2709
02:25:09,280 --> 02:25:14,960
red, red feminine, white masculine. and

2710
02:25:12,160 --> 02:25:18,960
they meet and it is the union of the

2711
02:25:14,960 --> 02:25:20,560
king and the queen from the alchemical

2712
02:25:18,960 --> 02:25:25,760
tradition

2713
02:25:20,560 --> 02:25:28,800
that gives birth to the child of light.

2714
02:25:25,760 --> 02:25:33,680
The philosophical stone is the pinal

2715
02:25:28,800 --> 02:25:38,000
gland. Okay. So the union the sacred

2716
02:25:33,680 --> 02:25:40,640
union is going to by um

2717
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:43,840
symbolical sexual or act of union

2718
02:25:40,640 --> 02:25:47,520
activate the vortex.

2719
02:25:43,840 --> 02:25:50,160
And what is the child of light?

2720
02:25:47,520 --> 02:25:53,359
It's

2721
02:25:50,160 --> 02:25:55,439
your higher self

2722
02:25:53,359 --> 02:25:58,000
igniting.

2723
02:25:55,439 --> 02:26:01,040
That's why you see the flower lotus

2724
02:25:58,000 --> 02:26:04,160
flower sometimes that opens or you see

2725
02:26:01,040 --> 02:26:07,520
wings that's the the the consciousness

2726
02:26:04,160 --> 02:26:10,080
that either blossom or either reaches

2727
02:26:07,520 --> 02:26:13,120
higher realms of consciousness.

2728
02:26:10,080 --> 02:26:15,359
This is why the kundalini is important.

2729
02:26:13,120 --> 02:26:18,640
This exercise is important because it is

2730
02:26:15,359 --> 02:26:22,319
your power. This is what was activated

2731
02:26:18,640 --> 02:26:25,760
in the human being to help him

2732
02:26:22,319 --> 02:26:28,800
evolve faster and beat the genetic

2733
02:26:25,760 --> 02:26:32,160
alterations of Enlil and his team. What

2734
02:26:28,800 --> 02:26:35,680
we've done with is to activate these

2735
02:26:32,160 --> 02:26:38,800
power, this this coil, this thing that

2736
02:26:35,680 --> 02:26:42,399
every human has.

2737
02:26:38,800 --> 02:26:46,160
This is present at different levels of

2738
02:26:42,399 --> 02:26:50,800
development in different species. But in

2739
02:26:46,160 --> 02:26:53,760
the human this double coil of power is

2740
02:26:50,800 --> 02:26:57,520
extremely powerful. That is what the the

2741
02:26:53,760 --> 02:26:59,680
regressive species have tried to

2742
02:26:57,520 --> 02:27:02,000
get

2743
02:26:59,680 --> 02:27:04,479
and to this day they haven't because

2744
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:06,880
it's impossible.

2745
02:27:04,479 --> 02:27:12,000
It's impossible because the soul the

2746
02:27:06,880 --> 02:27:15,120
human soul is the human soul. You cannot

2747
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:18,640
copy it.

2748
02:27:15,120 --> 02:27:21,840
You can understand how it works but you

2749
02:27:18,640 --> 02:27:24,479
cannot copy the frequency. That's why

2750
02:27:21,840 --> 02:27:28,319
the regressive have tried to hybridize

2751
02:27:24,479 --> 02:27:32,399
with humans but without success because

2752
02:27:28,319 --> 02:27:34,319
the soul has a nature that is intrinsic

2753
02:27:32,399 --> 02:27:39,120
and unique

2754
02:27:34,319 --> 02:27:41,680
and it cannot be copied.

2755
02:27:39,120 --> 02:27:43,840
Humans

2756
02:27:41,680 --> 02:27:49,200
awaken

2757
02:27:43,840 --> 02:27:54,359
Be who you are. Be who you are.

2758
02:27:49,200 --> 02:27:54,359
Just trust. Trust it. Trust yourself.

2759
02:27:56,640 --> 02:27:59,640
Um,

2760
02:28:01,439 --> 02:28:06,560
hi Lisa.

2761
02:28:04,720 --> 02:28:10,319
Dear Elena, what happens to our

2762
02:28:06,560 --> 02:28:13,200
personality and character when we die?

2763
02:28:10,319 --> 02:28:16,160
Are we exactly the same person just

2764
02:28:13,200 --> 02:28:18,640
without the body? The only thing I'm

2765
02:28:16,160 --> 02:28:21,120
afraid of when dying is not being myself

2766
02:28:18,640 --> 02:28:24,399
anymore with love and gratitude for

2767
02:28:21,120 --> 02:28:27,040
everything you do. Oh, Lisa, you stay

2768
02:28:24,399 --> 02:28:31,520
yourself.

2769
02:28:27,040 --> 02:28:34,840
Everything you you are,

2770
02:28:31,520 --> 02:28:34,840
you stay.

2771
02:28:37,680 --> 02:28:45,520
Unfortunately, the traumas come with you

2772
02:28:40,800 --> 02:28:47,760
as as much as the joys and the happiness

2773
02:28:45,520 --> 02:28:50,920
and this will be your luggage for the

2774
02:28:47,760 --> 02:28:50,920
next incarnation.

2775
02:28:54,720 --> 02:28:59,760
You will stay who you are.

2776
02:28:57,520 --> 02:29:02,080
You will not look exactly like you look

2777
02:28:59,760 --> 02:29:04,720
now. You will be a light being. You will

2778
02:29:02,080 --> 02:29:06,240
you have your human shape. You will be

2779
02:29:04,720 --> 02:29:10,359
translucent

2780
02:29:06,240 --> 02:29:10,359
and you will look more like

2781
02:29:10,399 --> 02:29:16,920
the the the the last state of evolution

2782
02:29:13,520 --> 02:29:16,920
of your soul.

2783
02:29:17,760 --> 02:29:21,319
So um

2784
02:29:21,600 --> 02:29:29,600
here I go. If you you know if you are an

2785
02:29:24,960 --> 02:29:34,080
agaroth star seed when you disambodi

2786
02:29:29,600 --> 02:29:37,760
or die or transition you look like an a

2787
02:29:34,080 --> 02:29:41,680
a translucent agaroth

2788
02:29:37,760 --> 02:29:44,960
that's best example

2789
02:29:41,680 --> 02:29:47,920
um question by bon

2790
02:29:44,960 --> 02:29:50,240
dearena do earth humans and deities who

2791
02:29:47,920 --> 02:29:52,880
experience physical death go through the

2792
02:29:50,240 --> 02:29:55,200
same process after death. For instance,

2793
02:29:52,880 --> 02:29:58,000
does everyone ascend through different

2794
02:29:55,200 --> 02:30:00,160
dimensions to return to source in

2795
02:29:58,000 --> 02:30:02,479
between lives if they so wish? How does

2796
02:30:00,160 --> 02:30:05,040
this work?

2797
02:30:02,479 --> 02:30:07,280
Uh

2798
02:30:05,040 --> 02:30:10,000
you can you can go back to source

2799
02:30:07,280 --> 02:30:11,600
whenever you want. You can go back home

2800
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:14,319
even to your own planet whenever you

2801
02:30:11,600 --> 02:30:19,560
want especially since the death trap has

2802
02:30:14,319 --> 02:30:19,560
been removed on earth, lifted. Um

2803
02:30:19,760 --> 02:30:25,600
but usually you ch you choose not to

2804
02:30:22,720 --> 02:30:28,560
because when you disbody you become

2805
02:30:25,600 --> 02:30:30,479
aware of

2806
02:30:28,560 --> 02:30:33,200
what you want to do or who you are of

2807
02:30:30,479 --> 02:30:35,200
course and of the bigger picture the

2808
02:30:33,200 --> 02:30:38,080
bigger perspective that you are here to

2809
02:30:35,200 --> 02:30:41,120
experience and that you are going to

2810
02:30:38,080 --> 02:30:43,760
incarnate to continue to experience or

2811
02:30:41,120 --> 02:30:47,160
amend what you've done wrong in in the

2812
02:30:43,760 --> 02:30:47,160
previous life.

2813
02:30:47,920 --> 02:30:53,040
Because your karma if for instance if

2814
02:30:50,080 --> 02:30:57,680
you hurt someone

2815
02:30:53,040 --> 02:31:02,800
and you do not make amend in the life

2816
02:30:57,680 --> 02:31:04,479
or you hurt this person you create an

2817
02:31:02,800 --> 02:31:09,120
entanglement

2818
02:31:04,479 --> 02:31:12,080
to this person. So you both

2819
02:31:09,120 --> 02:31:15,680
the the the one who's been hurting and

2820
02:31:12,080 --> 02:31:18,560
and victim will find themselves in the

2821
02:31:15,680 --> 02:31:20,720
next life together

2822
02:31:18,560 --> 02:31:23,280
because you've entangled something and

2823
02:31:20,720 --> 02:31:25,680
you will need to amend yourself with

2824
02:31:23,280 --> 02:31:27,120
this person and set this person free

2825
02:31:25,680 --> 02:31:30,000
because when you will do that it will

2826
02:31:27,120 --> 02:31:32,479
take away the trauma from this person

2827
02:31:30,000 --> 02:31:36,680
you know. So

2828
02:31:32,479 --> 02:31:36,680
um so not easy.

2829
02:31:40,479 --> 02:31:47,600
Hello. Am I a star seed or not?

2830
02:31:44,240 --> 02:31:49,680
How can I know? I feel so down to earth

2831
02:31:47,600 --> 02:31:52,080
sometimes. Maybe I am just a regular

2832
02:31:49,680 --> 02:31:55,359
Terran. But why am I so interested with

2833
02:31:52,080 --> 02:31:57,439
extraterrestrials? Thank you.

2834
02:31:55,359 --> 02:31:59,920
I would start to say, Jeanlu, you have

2835
02:31:57,439 --> 02:32:03,120
all the answers, of course, but that

2836
02:31:59,920 --> 02:32:08,200
would be a bit

2837
02:32:03,120 --> 02:32:08,200
not um very helpful.

2838
02:32:11,600 --> 02:32:18,600
Have you always been drawn to the stars?

2839
02:32:20,240 --> 02:32:26,640
Have you thought sometimes when you

2840
02:32:23,840 --> 02:32:28,880
looked at the starry sky

2841
02:32:26,640 --> 02:32:31,600
that you are not from here and that you

2842
02:32:28,880 --> 02:32:33,760
have people you love who are somewhere

2843
02:32:31,600 --> 02:32:36,080
else?

2844
02:32:33,760 --> 02:32:39,040
You can be drawn to extraterrestrials

2845
02:32:36,080 --> 02:32:41,280
without being one. You can be from Earth

2846
02:32:39,040 --> 02:32:44,280
and it's curiosity and excitement and

2847
02:32:41,280 --> 02:32:44,280
interest.

2848
02:32:47,840 --> 02:32:54,399
When you are a star seed, you know it

2849
02:32:52,240 --> 02:32:56,080
from the start.

2850
02:32:54,399 --> 02:32:58,720
You know it because you have this

2851
02:32:56,080 --> 02:33:01,439
calling to go back home in the stars.

2852
02:32:58,720 --> 02:33:04,560
Every time you look at the stars,

2853
02:33:01,439 --> 02:33:07,920
take your soul away. It takes everything

2854
02:33:04,560 --> 02:33:10,160
of you away and you you just want to be

2855
02:33:07,920 --> 02:33:12,720
there in the stars. That's where you

2856
02:33:10,160 --> 02:33:15,120
belong.

2857
02:33:12,720 --> 02:33:17,280
You know you're a star seed.

2858
02:33:15,120 --> 02:33:19,359
If you never get this feeling and just,

2859
02:33:17,280 --> 02:33:23,359
"Wow, that's nice. Look at the Milky

2860
02:33:19,359 --> 02:33:25,120
Way. Oh, great. You're from Earth.

2861
02:33:23,359 --> 02:33:28,479
You know,

2862
02:33:25,120 --> 02:33:32,399
if you are a star seed, you know it.

2863
02:33:28,479 --> 02:33:35,760
I hope this little um question can can

2864
02:33:32,399 --> 02:33:38,720
help you to find out. See what

2865
02:33:35,760 --> 02:33:41,600
magnetizes you more. Put yourself until

2866
02:33:38,720 --> 02:33:43,600
under a magnificent starry sky, summer

2867
02:33:41,600 --> 02:33:46,960
starry sky,

2868
02:33:43,600 --> 02:33:52,840
and see where you're drawn to up or

2869
02:33:46,960 --> 02:33:52,840
below. I think that's when it works.

2870
02:33:54,640 --> 02:34:01,359
Um, Maria, hi Maria.

2871
02:33:58,080 --> 02:34:04,880
Elena, the flis is a symbol of French

2872
02:34:01,359 --> 02:34:08,399
royalty. ah

2873
02:34:04,880 --> 02:34:11,120
other noble families and is also used in

2874
02:34:08,399 --> 02:34:13,280
rituals and meditations. I assume it is

2875
02:34:11,120 --> 02:34:16,399
related to royal blood or the holy

2876
02:34:13,280 --> 02:34:19,800
grail. But why this flower? What's

2877
02:34:16,399 --> 02:34:19,800
hidden there?

2878
02:34:30,960 --> 02:34:33,840
The grail.

2879
02:34:34,800 --> 02:34:42,080
The royal bloodline

2880
02:34:37,920 --> 02:34:44,960
descending from Adam and Eve.

2881
02:34:42,080 --> 02:34:47,920
This is the symbol

2882
02:34:44,960 --> 02:34:53,240
with the three prongs. You you curve

2883
02:34:47,920 --> 02:34:53,240
them a little bit. You have your flower.

2884
02:34:56,240 --> 02:34:59,880
I hope this answer

2885
02:35:03,280 --> 02:35:08,319
IM Hilena, can you update us on the

2886
02:35:06,240 --> 02:35:11,600
disclosure that the Galactic Federation

2887
02:35:08,319 --> 02:35:14,479
of World promise would happen in mid

2888
02:35:11,600 --> 02:35:16,399
2024? Thank you very much, beautiful and

2889
02:35:14,479 --> 02:35:18,319
loving Elena. So, that's a great

2890
02:35:16,399 --> 02:35:20,960
question because that allows me to talk

2891
02:35:18,319 --> 02:35:22,720
about time.

2892
02:35:20,960 --> 02:35:25,040
Time.

2893
02:35:22,720 --> 02:35:29,040
Yes, the plan of disclosure is going

2894
02:35:25,040 --> 02:35:33,600
well. Um it was it is still planned

2895
02:35:29,040 --> 02:35:38,319
before the end of 2024 now 2025

2896
02:35:33,600 --> 02:35:40,880
because I tell you something and um

2897
02:35:38,319 --> 02:35:44,840
my good friend Alex Kolier can uh

2898
02:35:40,880 --> 02:35:44,840
testify about that

2899
02:35:45,120 --> 02:35:50,080
facts

2900
02:35:47,840 --> 02:35:51,600
will happen

2901
02:35:50,080 --> 02:35:58,680
when

2902
02:35:51,600 --> 02:35:58,680
is not fixed. Okay, we can evaluate when

2903
02:35:58,720 --> 02:36:04,319
but the facts they will happen. When the

2904
02:36:01,600 --> 02:36:09,960
facts are planned and embedded, there is

2905
02:36:04,319 --> 02:36:09,960
no obstacle they will happen. But

2906
02:36:10,640 --> 02:36:15,960
now this is linear time. Okay.

2907
02:36:19,120 --> 02:36:25,840
Okay. you have, let's say, I'm going to

2908
02:36:21,840 --> 02:36:28,800
take my little um trident. Okay, this is

2909
02:36:25,840 --> 02:36:33,720
linear time. Okay,

2910
02:36:28,800 --> 02:36:33,720
okay, I'm I'm going to remove this.

2911
02:36:36,080 --> 02:36:43,280
You have on this linear time

2912
02:36:39,600 --> 02:36:48,319
fixed points which are like magnetic

2913
02:36:43,280 --> 02:36:55,479
anchors. Okay, this is disclosure. Okay,

2914
02:36:48,319 --> 02:36:55,479
evaluate period is 2024 mid 2024

2915
02:36:56,319 --> 02:37:02,160
that's now

2916
02:36:58,399 --> 02:37:03,920
to go from here to here it's not a

2917
02:37:02,160 --> 02:37:07,359
straight line otherwise we will

2918
02:37:03,920 --> 02:37:10,479
calculate like a scale the time exact.

2919
02:37:07,359 --> 02:37:13,200
No, to go from here to here. These are

2920
02:37:10,479 --> 02:37:16,720
fixed anchor points on the timeline. But

2921
02:37:13,200 --> 02:37:19,680
to go from here to here, you do it. You

2922
02:37:16,720 --> 02:37:23,760
choose the way you're going to go there.

2923
02:37:19,680 --> 02:37:27,120
So, it going to it can take so much more

2924
02:37:23,760 --> 02:37:30,920
time or not that much. It's depends on

2925
02:37:27,120 --> 02:37:30,920
the way you do it.

2926
02:37:33,120 --> 02:37:37,760
Can be also concerning cycles of

2927
02:37:35,040 --> 02:37:40,080
incarnations. That's a good point.

2928
02:37:37,760 --> 02:37:43,120
So

2929
02:37:40,080 --> 02:37:44,640
the in between

2930
02:37:43,120 --> 02:37:47,760
is

2931
02:37:44,640 --> 02:37:52,880
how we going to get to take down the

2932
02:37:47,760 --> 02:37:56,640
deep state for instance. Okay. If we we

2933
02:37:52,880 --> 02:37:58,720
do it faster, not a lot of winding and

2934
02:37:56,640 --> 02:38:01,840
convolution, we're going to get to this

2935
02:37:58,720 --> 02:38:05,680
point, this anchor point faster. But if

2936
02:38:01,840 --> 02:38:07,840
we just just don't know what to do and

2937
02:38:05,680 --> 02:38:09,520
just you know that's going to be take

2938
02:38:07,840 --> 02:38:14,319
ages.

2939
02:38:09,520 --> 02:38:16,960
Okay, consider this as a

2940
02:38:14,319 --> 02:38:19,600
notes of music.

2941
02:38:16,960 --> 02:38:24,080
Okay,

2942
02:38:19,600 --> 02:38:31,200
I can do it I can do it with sound.

2943
02:38:24,080 --> 02:38:33,840
Um for instance um this is like doido

2944
02:38:31,200 --> 02:38:37,120
between dome

2945
02:38:33,840 --> 02:38:40,399
which are

2946
02:38:37,120 --> 02:38:46,840
secure anchor points.

2947
02:38:40,399 --> 02:38:46,840
You can't either sorry you can either

2948
02:38:46,960 --> 02:38:52,640
uh go like

2949
02:38:50,319 --> 02:38:56,880
do

2950
02:38:52,640 --> 02:39:01,040
me that's very fast happens quite fast.

2951
02:38:56,880 --> 02:39:03,920
But if you mess up or you don't know

2952
02:39:01,040 --> 02:39:08,120
where you're going or you have obstacles

2953
02:39:03,920 --> 02:39:08,120
you can also do this.

2954
02:39:10,080 --> 02:39:16,240
way.

2955
02:39:12,800 --> 02:39:20,160
That's the linear time

2956
02:39:16,240 --> 02:39:22,640
anchor points and the way you get there.

2957
02:39:20,160 --> 02:39:25,040
That is why

2958
02:39:22,640 --> 02:39:26,960
when I was shown

2959
02:39:25,040 --> 02:39:28,880
the future of Earth on the metal

2960
02:39:26,960 --> 02:39:32,720
mothership,

2961
02:39:28,880 --> 02:39:34,240
the shortest I have been shown was 20

2962
02:39:32,720 --> 02:39:37,760
years.

2963
02:39:34,240 --> 02:39:40,880
I haven't been shown one year, 6 month,

2964
02:39:37,760 --> 02:39:42,880
3 days. Why? Because this is the in

2965
02:39:40,880 --> 02:39:44,640
between.

2966
02:39:42,880 --> 02:39:46,399
This is in the making. This is how

2967
02:39:44,640 --> 02:39:48,800
you're going to get there. And this is

2968
02:39:46,399 --> 02:39:51,359
moving all the time.

2969
02:39:48,800 --> 02:39:53,439
The future of earth is an as I saw it is

2970
02:39:51,359 --> 02:39:56,240
now an anchor point. When Thorhan told

2971
02:39:53,439 --> 02:39:58,160
me this, a timeline has been anchored.

2972
02:39:56,240 --> 02:40:00,960
By the way, there is only one timeline

2973
02:39:58,160 --> 02:40:03,040
at a time. That's very important. When

2974
02:40:00,960 --> 02:40:05,920
Tohan said that to me, it has been

2975
02:40:03,040 --> 02:40:08,319
anchored.

2976
02:40:05,920 --> 02:40:11,600
That meant that

2977
02:40:08,319 --> 02:40:15,359
key points to the progressive Star Trek

2978
02:40:11,600 --> 02:40:20,399
futures were anchored and locked,

2979
02:40:15,359 --> 02:40:24,640
secured. Now, how you get there?

2980
02:40:20,399 --> 02:40:29,120
It's humans to get there their ways.

2981
02:40:24,640 --> 02:40:31,760
That's why if I ask to see the earth in

2982
02:40:29,120 --> 02:40:35,359
between somewhere somewhere in between

2983
02:40:31,760 --> 02:40:37,920
the two anchor points from now to the 20

2984
02:40:35,359 --> 02:40:41,520
years time anchor point

2985
02:40:37,920 --> 02:40:43,200
one day I would have seen something and

2986
02:40:41,520 --> 02:40:45,120
the other day I would have think seen it

2987
02:40:43,200 --> 02:40:47,840
differently because human would suddenly

2988
02:40:45,120 --> 02:40:50,640
decide to do it differently or an

2989
02:40:47,840 --> 02:40:53,200
obstacle would have come and the day

2990
02:40:50,640 --> 02:40:56,479
after it would be something different.

2991
02:40:53,200 --> 02:41:00,080
But if I look in 20 years time is the

2992
02:40:56,479 --> 02:41:01,760
same because that's the anchor point.

2993
02:41:00,080 --> 02:41:04,760
Okay.

2994
02:41:01,760 --> 02:41:04,760
So

2995
02:41:05,439 --> 02:41:08,920
this is time

2996
02:41:10,640 --> 02:41:16,640
question by Ramiro Kuml.

2997
02:41:14,319 --> 02:41:18,800
Good evening Ramiro.

2998
02:41:16,640 --> 02:41:20,880
Dear Elena, could you confirm it if

2999
02:41:18,800 --> 02:41:23,600
souls like us are part of a larger

3000
02:41:20,880 --> 02:41:26,160
consciousness groups which in turn make

3001
02:41:23,600 --> 02:41:28,880
up even larger entities say archangel,

3002
02:41:26,160 --> 02:41:32,080
saraphim, etc. And what happens with our

3003
02:41:28,880 --> 02:41:35,200
earth identity once we disembodi? All

3004
02:41:32,080 --> 02:41:39,120
the best Ramro. Okay,

3005
02:41:35,200 --> 02:41:42,160
that sounds exciting. Um

3006
02:41:39,120 --> 02:41:45,800
so if souls like us are part of larger

3007
02:41:42,160 --> 02:41:45,800
consciousness groups

3008
02:41:46,000 --> 02:41:50,640
which in turn make up even larger

3009
02:41:47,760 --> 02:41:53,280
entities say archangels. Okay. Oh I got

3010
02:41:50,640 --> 02:41:56,439
you. I got you. I got you. Like the J

3011
02:41:53,280 --> 02:41:56,439
for instance.

3012
02:41:57,040 --> 02:42:02,319
Some Yes. Some species. Oh, you must be

3013
02:41:59,760 --> 02:42:05,800
a star seed from somewhere, Ramiru. Why

3014
02:42:02,319 --> 02:42:05,800
you remember that?

3015
02:42:06,080 --> 02:42:10,359
Because some species do that

3016
02:42:11,520 --> 02:42:16,720
in it's um it's it comes into the

3017
02:42:14,800 --> 02:42:19,359
individuated

3018
02:42:16,720 --> 02:42:21,920
uh collective consciousness or you can

3019
02:42:19,359 --> 02:42:25,479
have also the microhive consciousness

3020
02:42:21,920 --> 02:42:25,479
such as the German.

3021
02:42:26,160 --> 02:42:33,439
The German are in fact the best example.

3022
02:42:30,319 --> 02:42:39,120
There is one core entity that fractals

3023
02:42:33,439 --> 02:42:42,479
into many. Okay? And these ones,

3024
02:42:39,120 --> 02:42:45,760
the all the many will be part of a

3025
02:42:42,479 --> 02:42:51,120
larger spherical group of souls which

3026
02:42:45,760 --> 02:42:54,080
will be fractal of a origin soul point.

3027
02:42:51,120 --> 02:42:57,359
Okay? Get get me? So that's a bubble

3028
02:42:54,080 --> 02:43:00,479
group of German for instance microhive

3029
02:42:57,359 --> 02:43:02,640
and then you have another that comes and

3030
02:43:00,479 --> 02:43:04,960
another that comes and all of them are

3031
02:43:02,640 --> 02:43:07,280
parts of the greater collective of their

3032
02:43:04,960 --> 02:43:09,040
species collective consciousness of

3033
02:43:07,280 --> 02:43:13,520
their species.

3034
02:43:09,040 --> 02:43:17,640
So there are many different species who

3035
02:43:13,520 --> 02:43:17,640
are structured like that.

3036
02:43:17,840 --> 02:43:23,359
But for the all the other ones be the

3037
02:43:20,640 --> 02:43:26,319
individuated consciousness be he be be

3038
02:43:23,359 --> 02:43:29,120
the hive consciousness in the greater

3039
02:43:26,319 --> 02:43:33,680
perspective of the whole universe the

3040
02:43:29,120 --> 02:43:38,720
big bubble bubble multiverse

3041
02:43:33,680 --> 02:43:40,479
we are part of this big source thing.

3042
02:43:38,720 --> 02:43:43,040
So

3043
02:43:40,479 --> 02:43:45,359
yeah at the end we are

3044
02:43:43,040 --> 02:43:48,880
now there are people also consciousness

3045
02:43:45,359 --> 02:43:51,120
who are part of a individuated planetary

3046
02:43:48,880 --> 02:43:55,920
uh consciousness like the India movie

3047
02:43:51,120 --> 02:43:58,319
avatar and they can say they are part of

3048
02:43:55,920 --> 02:44:01,439
um for instance they are take the movie

3049
02:43:58,319 --> 02:44:05,520
avatar that's another good example

3050
02:44:01,439 --> 02:44:10,479
uh these blue humans are part of their

3051
02:44:05,520 --> 02:44:13,520
um species is individuated

3052
02:44:10,479 --> 02:44:16,960
collective consciousness and this bubble

3053
02:44:13,520 --> 02:44:20,399
is part of the planetary consciousness

3054
02:44:16,960 --> 02:44:22,720
a greater circle of life sphere of life

3055
02:44:20,399 --> 02:44:26,560
I would say

3056
02:44:22,720 --> 02:44:28,560
um so that it works for many species yes

3057
02:44:26,560 --> 02:44:31,279
well avatar they don't exist they are

3058
02:44:28,560 --> 02:44:33,600
fictional okay I'm not saying these are

3059
02:44:31,279 --> 02:44:35,520
real it's movie they're fictional but

3060
02:44:33,600 --> 02:44:38,160
that's a good example there's a lot of

3061
02:44:35,520 --> 02:44:41,040
disclosure in these movies avatar a lot

3062
02:44:38,160 --> 02:44:43,520
of disclosure

3063
02:44:41,040 --> 02:44:48,319
Romero for bringing it bringing this

3064
02:44:43,520 --> 02:44:51,040
subject. Thank you. Thank you. Um Mona

3065
02:44:48,319 --> 02:44:52,880
Monique, hello.

3066
02:44:51,040 --> 02:44:55,359
Hey Elena, thank you for your beauty and

3067
02:44:52,880 --> 02:44:59,040
grace. Oh, thank you. I'm going to put

3068
02:44:55,359 --> 02:45:00,560
you on the spot. Oh, apologize for that.

3069
02:44:59,040 --> 02:45:02,160
Oh my gosh, what's going to happen to

3070
02:45:00,560 --> 02:45:05,120
me?

3071
02:45:02,160 --> 02:45:07,840
I take all challenges. Okay, I'm pretty

3072
02:45:05,120 --> 02:45:11,359
certain I can't be the only one

3073
02:45:07,840 --> 02:45:14,880
questioning this. You're scaring me.

3074
02:45:11,359 --> 02:45:17,680
Is there going to be an event that will

3075
02:45:14,880 --> 02:45:19,680
wake the masses that refuse to see the

3076
02:45:17,680 --> 02:45:22,479
truth? The ones that are still holding

3077
02:45:19,680 --> 02:45:25,279
on to 3D.

3078
02:45:22,479 --> 02:45:28,160
Thank you, Mona. That's not such a big

3079
02:45:25,279 --> 02:45:34,960
thing. It's It's I love this question

3080
02:45:28,160 --> 02:45:39,040
because I love to debunk it. No.

3081
02:45:34,960 --> 02:45:41,200
Sorry I I like this question. Okay.

3082
02:45:39,040 --> 02:45:44,880
What we

3083
02:45:41,200 --> 02:45:49,279
there's two type of things again in this

3084
02:45:44,880 --> 02:45:53,040
this answer two answers. First

3085
02:45:49,279 --> 02:45:55,840
the event that is uh that will wake up

3086
02:45:53,040 --> 02:45:58,640
the masses that refuse to see the truth.

3087
02:45:55,840 --> 02:46:03,279
This has happened. It is called the

3088
02:45:58,640 --> 02:46:06,000
great awakening of humans of earth. It

3089
02:46:03,279 --> 02:46:08,160
has start already since the 1960s and

3090
02:46:06,000 --> 02:46:10,479
it's continuing through to this day.

3091
02:46:08,160 --> 02:46:12,000
It's not a singularity event. It's a

3092
02:46:10,479 --> 02:46:15,520
movement.

3093
02:46:12,000 --> 02:46:18,479
Okay. Movement of awakening. That is

3094
02:46:15,520 --> 02:46:21,600
what I would call the event in the

3095
02:46:18,479 --> 02:46:23,439
history of earth. The great event in the

3096
02:46:21,600 --> 02:46:25,120
history of earth. The awakening of

3097
02:46:23,439 --> 02:46:28,479
consciousness

3098
02:46:25,120 --> 02:46:31,600
of humans and their liberation.

3099
02:46:28,479 --> 02:46:36,080
Now besides that

3100
02:46:31,600 --> 02:46:38,800
the deep state has created this solar

3101
02:46:36,080 --> 02:46:41,840
flash pole shift. the poles are shifting

3102
02:46:38,800 --> 02:46:43,359
and there are solar flashes but I mean

3103
02:46:41,840 --> 02:46:46,720
um

3104
02:46:43,359 --> 02:46:49,840
like a scare event or something that is

3105
02:46:46,720 --> 02:46:52,160
going to do the job for you instead that

3106
02:46:49,840 --> 02:46:54,720
so they they took this narrative of the

3107
02:46:52,160 --> 02:46:57,600
event that is going to activate everyone

3108
02:46:54,720 --> 02:47:01,600
and they infiltrated it in all the new

3109
02:46:57,600 --> 02:47:06,080
age awakening movement and groups that

3110
02:47:01,600 --> 02:47:08,240
people suddenly start to believe that

3111
02:47:06,080 --> 02:47:10,640
something is going to happen that is

3112
02:47:08,240 --> 02:47:14,160
external to them that is going to

3113
02:47:10,640 --> 02:47:18,640
activate them. So they wait

3114
02:47:14,160 --> 02:47:23,600
and they do not do the job to go within

3115
02:47:18,640 --> 02:47:28,960
and meditate and find who they are.

3116
02:47:23,600 --> 02:47:31,200
That's clever. But we're more clever.

3117
02:47:28,960 --> 02:47:34,080
So there is no event that is going to

3118
02:47:31,200 --> 02:47:36,720
activate anyone. But there is a big

3119
02:47:34,080 --> 02:47:38,720
movement that has started since the

3120
02:47:36,720 --> 02:47:42,640
1960s that is called the great

3121
02:47:38,720 --> 02:47:46,240
awakening. That's what we call the

3122
02:47:42,640 --> 02:47:47,680
heaven in the history of earth.

3123
02:47:46,240 --> 02:47:50,680
Thank you Mona. That was a great

3124
02:47:47,680 --> 02:47:50,680
question.

3125
02:47:50,880 --> 02:47:56,560
Bridget uh from Switzerland.

3126
02:47:54,479 --> 02:48:01,640
Dear Elena, what happens to a soul that

3127
02:47:56,560 --> 02:48:01,640
is earthbound after death? Thanks.

3128
02:48:02,960 --> 02:48:08,720
You mean a soul from Earth? Because I

3129
02:48:07,359 --> 02:48:12,479
don't understand your question, I'm

3130
02:48:08,720 --> 02:48:14,319
going to take the two possibilities. If

3131
02:48:12,479 --> 02:48:18,319
you're talking about a soul that is from

3132
02:48:14,319 --> 02:48:20,560
Earth, not a star seed. Well, this soul

3133
02:48:18,319 --> 02:48:23,760
will uh only have the option to

3134
02:48:20,560 --> 02:48:26,080
incarnate back to Earth. It can go to

3135
02:48:23,760 --> 02:48:28,479
source directly and stop the process but

3136
02:48:26,080 --> 02:48:31,439
that will make it go back to the start.

3137
02:48:28,479 --> 02:48:34,080
So there's no point. This soul earthborn

3138
02:48:31,439 --> 02:48:35,680
earthling soul uh if earth is your home

3139
02:48:34,080 --> 02:48:38,880
world

3140
02:48:35,680 --> 02:48:42,080
you are going to reincarnate on earth

3141
02:48:38,880 --> 02:48:45,920
until you reach the higher state of

3142
02:48:42,080 --> 02:48:47,920
evolution and you reach the maximum you

3143
02:48:45,920 --> 02:48:51,800
can reach and then you can choose to

3144
02:48:47,920 --> 02:48:51,800
incarnate on other planets.

3145
02:48:51,920 --> 02:48:59,000
I I think I um I explained it earlier

3146
02:48:56,000 --> 02:48:59,000
on.

3147
02:49:00,080 --> 02:49:05,680
Okay.

3148
02:49:02,800 --> 02:49:07,760
Hello, dear Elena. Do you know about it

3149
02:49:05,680 --> 02:49:10,399
species and cultures who influence teran

3150
02:49:07,760 --> 02:49:15,000
matriarchal societies?

3151
02:49:10,399 --> 02:49:15,000
Thank you for your relentless work.

3152
02:49:15,439 --> 02:49:18,439
Um

3153
02:49:22,160 --> 02:49:25,920
No,

3154
02:49:24,399 --> 02:49:31,920
because

3155
02:49:25,920 --> 02:49:34,920
after a certain stage of evolution

3156
02:49:31,920 --> 02:49:34,920
um

3157
02:49:34,960 --> 02:49:40,560
roles are balance in a society.

3158
02:49:38,720 --> 02:49:43,200
There is no more patriarchy or

3159
02:49:40,560 --> 02:49:46,080
matriarchy when you reach out to an

3160
02:49:43,200 --> 02:49:49,920
evolved culture.

3161
02:49:46,080 --> 02:49:54,240
It's equal in the society.

3162
02:49:49,920 --> 02:49:57,600
So that's why um to my knowledge there

3163
02:49:54,240 --> 02:49:59,279
is no matriarchal culture

3164
02:49:57,600 --> 02:50:02,319
uh coming to earth as there is no

3165
02:49:59,279 --> 02:50:04,000
patriarchal culture except aha the

3166
02:50:02,319 --> 02:50:06,720
reptilians

3167
02:50:04,000 --> 02:50:08,640
there are patriarchal culture well you

3168
02:50:06,720 --> 02:50:11,359
see through the the mainstream religions

3169
02:50:08,640 --> 02:50:14,800
the influenced and liil was a nanomei

3170
02:50:11,359 --> 02:50:18,319
reptilian sikar say u who's a

3171
02:50:14,800 --> 02:50:21,200
patriarchal takeover of the world yes

3172
02:50:18,319 --> 02:50:24,200
reptilians patriarchal

3173
02:50:21,200 --> 02:50:24,200
matriarchal

3174
02:50:25,359 --> 02:50:31,359
not to my knowledge

3175
02:50:28,000 --> 02:50:33,840
um influencing earth.

3176
02:50:31,359 --> 02:50:37,840
There are plenty of matriarchal

3177
02:50:33,840 --> 02:50:40,479
societies in the universe plenty but not

3178
02:50:37,840 --> 02:50:45,040
in the context of influencing coming to

3179
02:50:40,479 --> 02:50:48,560
earth to my knowledge.

3180
02:50:45,040 --> 02:50:50,640
Isis love this name. Dear Elena and Tim,

3181
02:50:48,560 --> 02:50:53,600
I wonder if you can advise me how to

3182
02:50:50,640 --> 02:50:56,080
make contact with my soul group. I seems

3183
02:50:53,600 --> 02:50:59,439
to be stuck. All my life I've been

3184
02:50:56,080 --> 02:51:01,120
fascinated by the Andromeda galaxy. Will

3185
02:50:59,439 --> 02:51:03,920
you add more races in the future

3186
02:51:01,120 --> 02:51:08,319
anticipas from Andromeda?

3187
02:51:03,920 --> 02:51:11,680
I will for sure. Isis,

3188
02:51:08,319 --> 02:51:13,279
there is a way to connect to your soul

3189
02:51:11,680 --> 02:51:15,279
group.

3190
02:51:13,279 --> 02:51:18,560
When you connect to your own frequency,

3191
02:51:15,279 --> 02:51:21,120
when you shut off the noise,

3192
02:51:18,560 --> 02:51:24,479
embrace your the awareness of your body,

3193
02:51:21,120 --> 02:51:29,120
release it, go deeper

3194
02:51:24,479 --> 02:51:32,640
and connect with who you are. Be be who

3195
02:51:29,120 --> 02:51:35,640
is inside. Is be

3196
02:51:32,640 --> 02:51:35,640
it.

3197
02:51:37,040 --> 02:51:42,720
If you are fully this person inside of

3198
02:51:39,520 --> 02:51:45,439
you through meditation, you will start

3199
02:51:42,720 --> 02:51:47,840
vibrating in that frequency, the

3200
02:51:45,439 --> 02:51:50,800
frequency of the particles of your soul,

3201
02:51:47,840 --> 02:51:53,040
for your higher being. And then you will

3202
02:51:50,800 --> 02:51:54,640
be at the same frequency suddenly. Your

3203
02:51:53,040 --> 02:51:58,000
consciousness will vibrate at the same

3204
02:51:54,640 --> 02:52:00,399
frequency as your soul group

3205
02:51:58,000 --> 02:52:03,600
and then you will feel the connection.

3206
02:52:00,399 --> 02:52:05,680
You will hear them, feel them first. you

3207
02:52:03,600 --> 02:52:09,920
will be in contact because they have the

3208
02:52:05,680 --> 02:52:14,279
same frequency keys as you. That's how I

3209
02:52:09,920 --> 02:52:14,279
would recommend to do it.

3210
02:52:15,840 --> 02:52:21,359
Hey Phillip,

3211
02:52:18,560 --> 02:52:24,319
why the envoys choose a traumatic life

3212
02:52:21,359 --> 02:52:27,120
experience as if it's not difficult

3213
02:52:24,319 --> 02:52:29,200
enough having amnesia in 3D slave planet

3214
02:52:27,120 --> 02:52:30,880
if the successfulness of the envoy's

3215
02:52:29,200 --> 02:52:34,319
mission relays on his ability to

3216
02:52:30,880 --> 02:52:36,479
resonate with what he already knows. Why

3217
02:52:34,319 --> 02:52:39,279
making it even more difficult by adding

3218
02:52:36,479 --> 02:52:44,479
on purpose an extra layer of trauma? It

3219
02:52:39,279 --> 02:52:46,720
is so Felipe it is not um

3220
02:52:44,479 --> 02:52:51,760
uh generality.

3221
02:52:46,720 --> 02:52:54,800
It is some star seeds choose it to

3222
02:52:51,760 --> 02:52:56,640
either experience something that will

3223
02:52:54,800 --> 02:52:59,600
serve their

3224
02:52:56,640 --> 02:53:01,680
learning, their evolution

3225
02:52:59,600 --> 02:53:04,479
or either they choose to embrace a

3226
02:53:01,680 --> 02:53:07,760
trauma to lock on the frequency of this

3227
02:53:04,479 --> 02:53:09,840
trauma and to know it and to be able to

3228
02:53:07,760 --> 02:53:13,040
take the frequency of this trauma, this

3229
02:53:09,840 --> 02:53:15,359
experience and transmute it. and

3230
02:53:13,040 --> 02:53:17,680
transmuting it, being able to help

3231
02:53:15,359 --> 02:53:20,399
others.

3232
02:53:17,680 --> 02:53:22,800
In this life, in this incarnation, I

3233
02:53:20,399 --> 02:53:25,439
give you my example. I've chosen to have

3234
02:53:22,800 --> 02:53:27,600
an experience with an abusive husband, a

3235
02:53:25,439 --> 02:53:29,600
sociopath.

3236
02:53:27,600 --> 02:53:31,359
I chose this because I wanted to

3237
02:53:29,600 --> 02:53:35,439
experience the process and how you get

3238
02:53:31,359 --> 02:53:38,240
out of it. Now that I afterwards, that

3239
02:53:35,439 --> 02:53:40,800
was many years ago, learned how to get

3240
02:53:38,240 --> 02:53:43,840
out of it. Identified the frequency,

3241
02:53:40,800 --> 02:53:47,279
identified what it is, how it is to be

3242
02:53:43,840 --> 02:53:50,000
in it, and how do you get out? Because

3243
02:53:47,279 --> 02:53:53,840
I've learned, I experienced it, I can

3244
02:53:50,000 --> 02:53:58,240
use it now as a tool to teach people at

3245
02:53:53,840 --> 02:54:01,279
a greater scale how to get out of the

3246
02:53:58,240 --> 02:54:03,200
abusive relationship of the deep state

3247
02:54:01,279 --> 02:54:06,000
we're in.

3248
02:54:03,200 --> 02:54:08,880
So that's an example.

3249
02:54:06,000 --> 02:54:10,800
So sometimes you choose traumas

3250
02:54:08,880 --> 02:54:14,240
if you have to understand that it's a

3251
02:54:10,800 --> 02:54:16,240
tool for you to understand the mechanism

3252
02:54:14,240 --> 02:54:21,640
of that trauma

3253
02:54:16,240 --> 02:54:21,640
transcend it and help others.

3254
02:54:24,319 --> 02:54:32,560
Oh uh okay I thought I had deleted this

3255
02:54:27,359 --> 02:54:35,120
one. Um Mona what about DNA ancestry

3256
02:54:32,560 --> 02:54:36,640
research companies? They collect our DNA

3257
02:54:35,120 --> 02:54:38,240
because they are still searching for

3258
02:54:36,640 --> 02:54:41,760
specific people with the right key in

3259
02:54:38,240 --> 02:54:45,200
their DNA. Right. Yes. Do you know more

3260
02:54:41,760 --> 02:54:47,760
about Slavic people DNA and who is their

3261
02:54:45,200 --> 02:54:50,960
great mother? Thank you Lena very much

3262
02:54:47,760 --> 02:54:53,960
for everything you are doing for us.

3263
02:54:50,960 --> 02:54:53,960
Okay.

3264
02:54:54,640 --> 02:55:00,800
Yes. um

3265
02:54:57,120 --> 02:55:04,399
some company like ancestry.com or things

3266
02:55:00,800 --> 02:55:07,920
like that they are um collecting DNA to

3267
02:55:04,399 --> 02:55:11,720
map the DNA of humanity to know who is

3268
02:55:07,920 --> 02:55:11,720
who and who is where.

3269
02:55:12,560 --> 02:55:16,880
So

3270
02:55:14,560 --> 02:55:21,040
it's like a you know database of

3271
02:55:16,880 --> 02:55:25,200
humanity DNA. So I I'm not trusting

3272
02:55:21,040 --> 02:55:26,960
this. The Slavic people

3273
02:55:25,200 --> 02:55:28,560
Who's the mother? That's very

3274
02:55:26,960 --> 02:55:31,560
interesting.

3275
02:55:28,560 --> 02:55:31,560
Um

3276
02:55:33,680 --> 02:55:39,840
the the Slavic people come from north of

3277
02:55:37,439 --> 02:55:42,800
the Black Sea. They were the Tripellian

3278
02:55:39,840 --> 02:55:48,800
Kuteni culture who left the Black Sea

3279
02:55:42,800 --> 02:55:52,160
short in um minus 8,500 BC.

3280
02:55:48,800 --> 02:55:55,840
They were

3281
02:55:52,160 --> 02:55:59,040
worshiping a great mother.

3282
02:55:55,840 --> 02:56:00,399
Her name was Danu.

3283
02:55:59,040 --> 02:56:02,160
That's why you have the the river

3284
02:56:00,399 --> 02:56:04,160
Danube.

3285
02:56:02,160 --> 02:56:06,960
Um

3286
02:56:04,160 --> 02:56:10,319
she may have taken different names when

3287
02:56:06,960 --> 02:56:13,439
they spread in the Slavic countries,

3288
02:56:10,319 --> 02:56:16,800
but this is

3289
02:56:13,439 --> 02:56:20,399
where it comes from. Denu the the

3290
02:56:16,800 --> 02:56:23,399
fertile mother goddess of earth, earth

3291
02:56:20,399 --> 02:56:23,399
goddess.

3292
02:56:24,720 --> 02:56:29,000
Beautiful, beautiful tradition.

3293
02:56:31,520 --> 02:56:38,319
Um, oh, we reach soon. I think that's

3294
02:56:35,120 --> 02:56:40,880
going to be the last question. Oh, I

3295
02:56:38,319 --> 02:56:45,520
have a tradition. I answer last question

3296
02:56:40,880 --> 02:56:47,920
and then I pick one in the list. So, uh,

3297
02:56:45,520 --> 02:56:52,160
I'm going to answer this one with 10

3298
02:56:47,920 --> 02:56:53,760
votes from Marott Hame.

3299
02:56:52,160 --> 02:56:56,160
Dear Elena, some questions about the

3300
02:56:53,760 --> 02:56:57,920
consciousness of planets and suns. Is it

3301
02:56:56,160 --> 02:57:01,200
correct to assume that planets are

3302
02:56:57,920 --> 02:57:06,439
infused with a feminine soul key and the

3303
02:57:01,200 --> 02:57:06,439
suns by a masculine soul's soul?

3304
02:57:06,640 --> 02:57:09,640
Um,

3305
02:57:09,840 --> 02:57:18,960
it would. So, I'm answering that first.

3306
02:57:14,960 --> 02:57:21,359
It would seem like something uh logical.

3307
02:57:18,960 --> 02:57:26,240
I remind you

3308
02:57:21,359 --> 02:57:28,800
uh I don't know from what country or um

3309
02:57:26,240 --> 02:57:34,479
culture you your originate what what is

3310
02:57:28,800 --> 02:57:37,880
um your um um your name can guess

3311
02:57:34,479 --> 02:57:37,880
probably Europe.

3312
02:57:38,560 --> 02:57:43,600
Um

3313
02:57:40,479 --> 02:57:46,640
the German people

3314
02:57:43,600 --> 02:57:49,040
call the sun feminine for instance and

3315
02:57:46,640 --> 02:57:51,520
the moon for instance masculine. So it

3316
02:57:49,040 --> 02:57:53,760
depends on the culture. Okay. But then

3317
02:57:51,520 --> 02:57:56,080
we all Okay.

3318
02:57:53,760 --> 02:57:57,600
The earth has more tendency to be

3319
02:57:56,080 --> 02:58:01,680
feminine

3320
02:57:57,600 --> 02:58:03,520
experience as feminine consciousness.

3321
02:58:01,680 --> 02:58:05,439
Although it's not a binary

3322
02:58:03,520 --> 02:58:08,399
consciousness. The planet the the

3323
02:58:05,439 --> 02:58:10,399
consciousness that come into the planets

3324
02:58:08,399 --> 02:58:14,240
and the suns are not binary. They are

3325
02:58:10,399 --> 02:58:16,560
they are whole not neutral whole both

3326
02:58:14,240 --> 02:58:19,359
together.

3327
02:58:16,560 --> 02:58:23,200
So we experience earth as a feminine

3328
02:58:19,359 --> 02:58:25,760
because she's the cauldron of all life

3329
02:58:23,200 --> 02:58:29,279
where all life germinates. She's like a

3330
02:58:25,760 --> 02:58:33,920
womb you know a goddess. So we have

3331
02:58:29,279 --> 02:58:36,560
tendency to feel her like her ga but in

3332
02:58:33,920 --> 02:58:38,640
fact it's it's it's not really feminine

3333
02:58:36,560 --> 02:58:40,800
it's

3334
02:58:38,640 --> 02:58:44,399
both

3335
02:58:40,800 --> 02:58:46,960
but the the the feminine creative aspect

3336
02:58:44,399 --> 02:58:51,439
of nurturing is more prominent that's

3337
02:58:46,960 --> 02:58:54,160
what we experience the sun as we call

3338
02:58:51,439 --> 02:58:57,200
this star soul

3339
02:58:54,160 --> 02:59:00,399
is experienced as a creative burning

3340
02:58:57,200 --> 02:59:03,279
being fiery power.

3341
02:59:00,399 --> 02:59:07,760
That's how we experience them. They're

3342
02:59:03,279 --> 02:59:11,720
not really binary, you know, because

3343
02:59:07,760 --> 02:59:11,720
they they don't have the

3344
02:59:12,399 --> 02:59:18,000
biological binary, but also they they

3345
02:59:15,279 --> 02:59:19,520
have the

3346
02:59:18,000 --> 02:59:21,840
duality,

3347
02:59:19,520 --> 02:59:25,840
not the binary, the duality is

3348
02:59:21,840 --> 02:59:29,840
different. Okay? The duality of creation

3349
02:59:25,840 --> 02:59:34,399
disruption. A sun can create life by its

3350
02:59:29,840 --> 02:59:36,800
warmth and radiation but also destroy.

3351
02:59:34,399 --> 02:59:38,640
The earth can create and destroy as well

3352
02:59:36,800 --> 02:59:41,040
by earthquakes for instance or

3353
02:59:38,640 --> 02:59:44,319
volcanoes.

3354
02:59:41,040 --> 02:59:47,439
They are dual but um we we experience

3355
02:59:44,319 --> 02:59:48,720
them differently.

3356
02:59:47,439 --> 02:59:51,120
Or you have something else in your

3357
02:59:48,720 --> 02:59:54,800
question more. So since there is a

3358
02:59:51,120 --> 02:59:56,640
galactic binary central sun is there an

3359
02:59:54,800 --> 02:59:59,040
intergalactic

3360
02:59:56,640 --> 03:00:02,399
sun also and are they infused with a

3361
02:59:59,040 --> 03:00:06,000
soul or several soul?

3362
03:00:02,399 --> 03:00:08,160
The galactic center is um is one the

3363
03:00:06,000 --> 03:00:11,520
galaxy is one consciousness we call her

3364
03:00:08,160 --> 03:00:14,080
mother but in fact it's the same. It's a

3365
03:00:11,520 --> 03:00:16,720
dual um

3366
03:00:14,080 --> 03:00:18,640
consciousness.

3367
03:00:16,720 --> 03:00:20,479
um

3368
03:00:18,640 --> 03:00:24,240
intergalactic.

3369
03:00:20,479 --> 03:00:27,040
When we see at the greater scale,

3370
03:00:24,240 --> 03:00:31,840
we see that our galaxies are linked by a

3371
03:00:27,040 --> 03:00:34,800
a network of like threads and lines.

3372
03:00:31,840 --> 03:00:38,080
It's the Liaakia cluster, galactic

3373
03:00:34,800 --> 03:00:39,680
cluster. It is not structured as

3374
03:00:38,080 --> 03:00:43,040
something with a center. There's no

3375
03:00:39,680 --> 03:00:47,520
center in Lakia. So in the universe,

3376
03:00:43,040 --> 03:00:47,520
there's no really central

3377
03:00:48,319 --> 03:00:52,720
poor because otherwise you will need

3378
03:00:51,200 --> 03:00:57,120
gravity

3379
03:00:52,720 --> 03:01:00,000
the the Lakia cluster they are it's not

3380
03:00:57,120 --> 03:01:02,880
there's not a central gravity

3381
03:01:00,000 --> 03:01:06,080
uh pool it's the galaxies which are

3382
03:01:02,880 --> 03:01:09,760
linked to each other by the galaxy's own

3383
03:01:06,080 --> 03:01:15,520
gravity fields but there's not a center

3384
03:01:09,760 --> 03:01:17,680
so it stopped quite quickly and remember

3385
03:01:15,520 --> 03:01:23,960
source is everywhere. It's not either a

3386
03:01:17,680 --> 03:01:23,960
center in in space or in time.

3387
03:01:24,240 --> 03:01:29,040
Thank you for your question, Maretta.

3388
03:01:26,399 --> 03:01:32,720
And now

3389
03:01:29,040 --> 03:01:35,720
I'm going to get to choose the last one.

3390
03:01:32,720 --> 03:01:35,720
Um

3391
03:01:41,359 --> 03:01:47,640
um

3392
03:01:42,960 --> 03:01:47,640
questions I haven't answered yet.

3393
03:01:52,160 --> 03:01:59,160
I'm going to go to the bottom.

3394
03:01:55,200 --> 03:01:59,160
There you go. I stop here.

3395
03:02:03,120 --> 03:02:08,359
Oh, there's a question I've answered

3396
03:02:04,720 --> 03:02:08,359
already. Um,

3397
03:02:12,960 --> 03:02:19,520
okay, I'll answer this one because it's

3398
03:02:15,840 --> 03:02:23,359
um it's a very very important one to

3399
03:02:19,520 --> 03:02:26,720
help you understand. It will help a lot.

3400
03:02:23,359 --> 03:02:31,200
Randall J1.

3401
03:02:26,720 --> 03:02:35,120
So, um that's my chosen question for

3402
03:02:31,200 --> 03:02:37,600
finishing this um this webinar. Um

3403
03:02:35,120 --> 03:02:41,200
Randy, you say

3404
03:02:37,600 --> 03:02:43,680
um hi Melina. This may sound silly. It's

3405
03:02:41,200 --> 03:02:47,200
just that I'm trying to understand how

3406
03:02:43,680 --> 03:02:49,040
one can leave the physical avatar

3407
03:02:47,200 --> 03:02:52,319
somewhere and then have your

3408
03:02:49,040 --> 03:02:55,279
consciousness somewhere else such as on

3409
03:02:52,319 --> 03:02:57,680
the ships and still have all the

3410
03:02:55,279 --> 03:02:59,920
physical sensations.

3411
03:02:57,680 --> 03:03:03,040
Oh yes, there's confusion. Is this

3412
03:02:59,920 --> 03:03:05,520
related to information about 4D beings

3413
03:03:03,040 --> 03:03:09,439
just as physical feeling as 3D? Thank

3414
03:03:05,520 --> 03:03:13,439
you. Okay. So

3415
03:03:09,439 --> 03:03:16,640
if you leave your body on earth in your

3416
03:03:13,439 --> 03:03:21,200
bed for instance at night and something

3417
03:03:16,640 --> 03:03:23,200
of you is projected on a spaceship

3418
03:03:21,200 --> 03:03:25,279
and you feel everything is physical.

3419
03:03:23,200 --> 03:03:27,600
Okay.

3420
03:03:25,279 --> 03:03:30,479
This is not astral travel because if you

3421
03:03:27,600 --> 03:03:32,479
do astral travel,

3422
03:03:30,479 --> 03:03:34,640
your body will be translucent,

3423
03:03:32,479 --> 03:03:39,399
transparent, and you won't be really

3424
03:03:34,640 --> 03:03:39,399
able to touch things. It would be weird.

3425
03:03:39,600 --> 03:03:47,359
If you get out of your body and you are

3426
03:03:44,399 --> 03:03:49,680
um transposed in onto a ship, it's

3427
03:03:47,359 --> 03:03:52,640
because

3428
03:03:49,680 --> 03:03:54,560
I've done that in the past before

3429
03:03:52,640 --> 03:03:56,479
starting to be teleported. They've done

3430
03:03:54,560 --> 03:03:59,800
that to me for me to experience all the

3431
03:03:56,479 --> 03:03:59,800
the aspects.

3432
03:04:01,439 --> 03:04:09,279
Your u your consciousness is projected

3433
03:04:05,840 --> 03:04:12,880
but rematerialized

3434
03:04:09,279 --> 03:04:15,680
in in in physical regarding the plane of

3435
03:04:12,880 --> 03:04:18,960
density. These beings are for instance

3436
03:04:15,680 --> 03:04:21,359
fifth density your your your ESB is

3437
03:04:18,960 --> 03:04:25,920
going to be projected

3438
03:04:21,359 --> 03:04:28,080
but not in astral your I mean it's

3439
03:04:25,920 --> 03:04:30,000
difficult to say

3440
03:04:28,080 --> 03:04:32,160
it's more of your consciousness that's

3441
03:04:30,000 --> 03:04:33,760
been projected and then you are

3442
03:04:32,160 --> 03:04:36,399
rematerialized

3443
03:04:33,760 --> 03:04:38,560
in a physical body there it's your same

3444
03:04:36,399 --> 03:04:40,560
atoms the same particles but they are

3445
03:04:38,560 --> 03:04:42,319
densified

3446
03:04:40,560 --> 03:04:44,640
and then you can have the physical

3447
03:04:42,319 --> 03:04:48,720
sensations The problem with that it

3448
03:04:44,640 --> 03:04:51,680
doesn't last long. It's very versatile

3449
03:04:48,720 --> 03:04:53,600
and uh there's a big magnetic field that

3450
03:04:51,680 --> 03:04:55,920
needs to contain all the particles as

3451
03:04:53,600 --> 03:04:58,160
solids and that doesn't last long and it

3452
03:04:55,920 --> 03:05:01,920
poof

3453
03:04:58,160 --> 03:05:04,640
uh very quickly. So that's the two uh

3454
03:05:01,920 --> 03:05:08,800
ways either astral travel but it's not

3455
03:05:04,640 --> 03:05:12,240
very physical or either um light

3456
03:05:08,800 --> 03:05:15,520
transfer resonance light transfer

3457
03:05:12,240 --> 03:05:19,120
resonance and you are rematerialized as

3458
03:05:15,520 --> 03:05:22,160
a solid body which is temporary solution

3459
03:05:19,120 --> 03:05:25,359
so um you couldn't move there and start

3460
03:05:22,160 --> 03:05:28,080
a life you know what I mean so um that's

3461
03:05:25,359 --> 03:05:30,960
what I would say

3462
03:05:28,080 --> 03:05:33,359
well Um,

3463
03:05:30,960 --> 03:05:36,160
everyone,

3464
03:05:33,359 --> 03:05:39,520
it's been an amazing um, moment in your

3465
03:05:36,160 --> 03:05:44,560
company. I've loved all the questions.

3466
03:05:39,520 --> 03:05:47,359
I'm going to go back now to the live

3467
03:05:44,560 --> 03:05:52,800
chat

3468
03:05:47,359 --> 03:05:56,319
and um I hope you you learn from uh

3469
03:05:52,800 --> 03:06:00,720
information from this webinar and u what

3470
03:05:56,319 --> 03:06:03,200
what I I I I hope I dream is that it's

3471
03:06:00,720 --> 03:06:05,359
it's okay to it's it's one thing to

3472
03:06:03,200 --> 03:06:09,600
learn

3473
03:06:05,359 --> 03:06:12,560
stuff but It's

3474
03:06:09,600 --> 03:06:16,960
the thing

3475
03:06:12,560 --> 03:06:20,640
to take it as a tool and a luggage

3476
03:06:16,960 --> 03:06:24,399

So,

3491
03:06:58,720 --> 03:07:02,520
my beloved ones,

3492
03:07:03,040 --> 03:07:11,439
uh, I wish you make amazing use of these

3493
03:07:08,319 --> 03:07:14,160
new tools you've learned today or that I

3494
03:07:11,439 --> 03:07:18,000
helped you remember. That's, you know,

3495
03:07:14,160 --> 03:07:20,080
more more precise.

3496
03:07:18,000 --> 03:07:23,439
Everything's in you. You don't need

3497
03:07:20,080 --> 03:07:28,160
anyone to tell you who you are,

3498
03:07:23,439 --> 03:07:31,120
where you come from, or why you're here.

3499
03:07:28,160 --> 03:07:33,200
The safest way to know it is

3500
03:07:31,120 --> 03:07:35,040
introspection,

3501
03:07:33,200 --> 03:07:40,160
meditation,

3502
03:07:35,040 --> 03:07:44,479
attunement with your inner being, your

3503
03:07:40,160 --> 03:07:47,120
higher vibrational self.

3504
03:07:44,479 --> 03:07:53,720
You need no one

3505
03:07:47,120 --> 03:07:53,720
but you. And I love you because

3506
03:07:54,319 --> 03:07:59,520
you're amazing. I'm very proud of you.

3507
03:07:57,520 --> 03:08:02,640
So proud.

3508
03:07:59,520 --> 03:08:04,800
You have no idea.

3509
03:08:02,640 --> 03:08:07,600
And I have witnessed the love you are

3510
03:08:04,800 --> 03:08:12,399
able to generate.

3511
03:08:07,600 --> 03:08:14,800
This gives me so much hope

3512
03:08:12,399 --> 03:08:16,720
and joy

3513
03:08:14,800 --> 03:08:19,040
that we didn't come back from nothing

3514
03:08:16,720 --> 03:08:23,960
for nothing.

3515
03:08:19,040 --> 03:08:23,960
I love you so much.
