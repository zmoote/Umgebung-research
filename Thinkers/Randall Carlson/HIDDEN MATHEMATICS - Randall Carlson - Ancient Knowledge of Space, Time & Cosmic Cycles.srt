1
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:14,720
hello i'm randall carlson and i would like to 
welcome you to a very special episode of after  

2
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:21,920
school i'm a designer and builder by profession 
but have for many years been an avid investigator  

3
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:27,680
into the marvels and mysteries of this amazing 
world we inhabit i would like to invite you  

4
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:34,560
to join us here on a journey into the realm of 
sacred number and symbol and the forms patterns  

5
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:41,840
and cycles of both space and time in which these 
numbers are embedded today thanks to the talented  

6
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:48,400
team at after school we'll take a peek behind 
the veil into the ancient symbolism of sacred  

7
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:56,320
number that still exists as part of our everyday 
lives the animation format employed here is a  

8
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:11,840
powerful medium for conveying the essence of this 
knowledge and so without further ado let us begin  

9
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:19,759
so what is the universal language it's symbolism 
it's it's number and symbolism and form and  

10
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:26,000
number symbolism and form are universal regardless 
of the spoken tongue uh which one happens to have  

11
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:35,680
been brought up in and hopefully in the next 
hour hour and a half i'm going to be showing   you examples of this so that you can see for 
yourself what actually the universal language of  

12
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:42,000
of geometry and symbolism actually means so we're 
going to jump right into it here and talk about  

13
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,520
sacred numbers embedded in everyday phenomena 
these are the things that we all pretty much  

14
00:01:48,640 --> 00:02:01,120
think about and use on a daily basis without ever 
really pondering the fact that there's actually   deep symbolism hidden within them we measure 
our life in terms of days of 24 hours referred  

15
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:09,440
to as a tropical or solar day and it turns out 
that 24 of these hours are 1404 minutes this is  

16
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:15,600
one of the key numbers within the ancient canon 
of numerical cosmology that the ancients used  

17
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:23,520
to basically design and create their world 
the 440 minutes equates to 86 400 seconds  

18
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:29,200
so if you just listen to these numbers look at 
them and let them kind of soak into your brain  

19
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:35,840
once you've gotten into this as a as a actually a 
system a methodology of transmitting information  

20
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:43,520
these numbers are actually carriers of information 
because each number stands for meanings beyond  

21
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:51,120
just the apparent ones so we see 1440 minutes 
is equal to 86 400 seconds and a twelve hour  

22
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:58,000
span of time which is usually represented 
on the the clock uh 720 minutes which equals  

23
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,600
forty three thousand two hundred seconds so 
just look at those numbers you'll think that  

24
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:07,840
obviously forty three thousand two hundred 
is half of eighty six thousand four hundred  

25
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:18,480
the fourteen hundred and forty we're gonna 
we're gonna counter that number again   here momentarily so these are just examples of 
some of the time measures how we think about time  

26
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:25,840
in our particular culture space measure we talk 
about a foot we talk about uh of 12 inches we  

27
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:32,640
talk about a square foot you'll notice that the 
square foot has the same repetition of digits 144  

28
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:38,720
as the 24 hours does all we do is we tack a zero 
on that we have the number of minutes in a day  

29
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,840
we have a cubic foot equaling 1728 i want 
to call your attention to the one square  

30
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:53,040
yard which is 1296 inches as it turns out we 
could stick a zero on the end of that we have  

31
00:03:53,600 --> 00:04:00,000
12 960 years which turns out to be an 
awesomely important span of time in terms of  

32
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,800
some of the great cycles that affect this planet 
and and that's what we're going to be getting to  

33
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:13,120
uh geometry everybody knows that a circumference 
of a circle is divided into 360 degrees and that  

34
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:20,400
360 degrees of arc because each degree 
is subdivided into minutes of arc there  

35
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:26,800
was then 60 times 360 as it says there 
are 21 600 and then you'll notice the 21  

36
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:36,000
600 minutes of arc equals 1 million 296 000 
seconds of arc that's a mighty fine subdivision of  

37
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:44,240
a circle that would be used mostly by astronomers 
to measure the motion of distant stars but notice  

38
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:54,320
that number one million two hundred ninety 
six thousand and you'll see that it's the same   number just raised by three orders of magnitude 
as the number of square inches in a square yard  

39
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:03,760
okay now another thing you might notice about most 
of these numbers from 1440 to 8640 43 200 144 1728  

40
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:10,720
36 1296 is that they all kabbalistically 
add up and reduce to the single digit 9.  

41
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:17,439
notice that all of them pick any one of them 
other than say with the exception of 24 but 1440  

42
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:23,040
adds and reduces to a single digit nine 1296 
you'll notice the same thing one and two and  

43
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:30,240
nine and six is eighteen which adds to a nine 
okay so have you if you're taking notes write  

44
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,160
these down or make mental notes of these numbers 
because these are the numbers we're going to be  

45
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:40,720
encountering now as we go progress through 
this through this journey here into the hidden  

46
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:47,440
mathematics so we will start by looking at how 
some of these same numbers and other numbers  

47
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:54,720
are associated with the measures of geometry 
and here we have what i refer to as the alphabet  

48
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:00,320
of sacred geometry and these are the simplest 
forms these are the polygons you have a circle  

49
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:10,400
which is actually not a polygon but we have an 
equilateral triangle a square and a pentagon   and each of these can be measured by the 
number of degrees that determine the angles  

50
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:17,280
of the sides so for example we look at a circle 
which is just a special case of an ellipse with  

51
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:22,400
eccentricity of zero we've covered this already 
so let's go right to the equilateral triangle  

52
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:29,759
and we'll see it's 60 60 and 60 which equals 180 
degrees again notice that we've got the number 9  

53
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:36,560
recurring we go to the square which is 4 times 
90 degrees the total number of degrees defining  

54
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:43,120
the square is 360 the same as the circle the same 
as the measure of a circle and we measure the  

55
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:49,919
polygons by essentially measuring the angles of 
the vertices or the corners so then likewise with  

56
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:57,760
the pentagon each of the angles between successive 
edges is 108 degrees so you multiply the 108 times  

57
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:05,920
5 and you get 540. again notice everything adds 
up to nine for some strange reason 108 is going  

58
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:17,840
to turn out to be a very important number 
it's a lunar number as you're going to see   108 anybody know what metal has an atomic weight 
of silver that i mean atomic weight of 108 yes  

59
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:25,120
that's right it's silver very good all right 
so let's get into some of the solid tetrahedron  

60
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:34,000
is this form right here and it's composed of four 
of the equilateral triangles so we have as it says  

61
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:42,160
here there's four triangular faces four times 180 
is 720 degrees that is the total angular measure  

62
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:49,040
of this particular geometric form this is known 
as one of the platonic solids or regular polyhedra  

63
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:55,920
polyhedra means multiple faces and the regular 
polyhedra is the family of five there's only five  

64
00:07:55,920 --> 00:08:04,080
that have the same shape or the same polygonal 
face in this case the equilateral triangle and  

65
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:14,560
then we will move on to the cube and the cube is 
six faces and they're each square and we saw that  

66
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:22,080
that each of those square faces had 360 degrees 
6 times 360. the important thing is to grasp that  

67
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:30,960
the total number of degrees in this form is 2160 
2160 and we're going to find out that that number  

68
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:36,640
actually turns out to be pretty significant in 
the measure of other parts of time and space  

69
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:44,160
then we'll go to the octahedron 
and it has eight triangular faces  

70
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:51,520
this is our octahedron right here and they're 
all you'll notice that so far the the tetrahedron  

71
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:57,280
and the octahedron are both composed of 
triangular equilateral triangular faces  

72
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:05,680
and essentially if you look at the difference 
between the tetrahedron and the octahedron   you could just imagine that if we could take 
the tetrahedron and split it along an edge  

73
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:11,839
and insert a fourth triangular face it would cause 
it to flatten out somewhat and it would give us  

74
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:19,440
the top half of the octahedron and likewise we 
could insert a fifth equilateral triangle in  

75
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:28,720
here and it's going to give us the icosahedron 
which i'll show you in a minute if we tried to   insert a sixth one though we discovered that the 
whole thing flattened out into two dimensions so  

76
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:41,920
that wouldn't work as far as enclosing 
space so in any case notice we're seeing   a recurrence of this number that we saw 
1440. remember we saw that number back right

77
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:53,520
right here the number of minutes in a day so 
let that that relationship sink in the number  

78
00:09:53,520 --> 00:10:01,920
of minutes in the time that it takes our earth to 
spin exactly once on its axis relative to the sun  

79
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:06,560
happens to be the same number of 
degrees that define the octahedron

80
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:19,840
and that's actually what we're talking about then 
when we're talking about a tropical or solar day   we're talking about one exactly one rotation 
of the earth on its axis relative to the sun

81
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:33,920
okay then we have the icosahedron

82
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:42,240
which is 20 faces all equilateral triangles 
you can see if you look at the vertex of this  

83
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:48,560
thing you see that there are five faces clustered 
around each vertex so if we were to split an edge  

84
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:55,680
insert another triangle what it would happen is 
it would flatten out into a hexagon a flat hexagon  

85
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:01,600
with six equilateral triangles about its center in 
any case there are 20 of these triangular faces 20  

86
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:11,920
times 180 is 3600 so again we have one of our 
nines and then our final is our dodecahedron  

87
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:23,759
my favorite shape this is what plato 
referred to the dodecahedron as being   the the shape of the universe itself 
the dodecahedron you'll notice has uh  

88
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:31,280
12 faces 20 vertices whereas the icosahedron has 
20 faces and 12 vertices so they're duals of each  

89
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:37,120
other we could actually suspend this icosahedron 
if the dodecahedron was hollow we could put it  

90
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:42,560
inside we would discover that each corner 
of the icosahedron coincided with the center  

91
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:49,680
of the pentagonal face of the doe decahedron okay 
each pentagonal face as we found out was a each  

92
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:59,279
edge was 108 5 times 108 540 12 times 540 as it 
says is 6480. so again we've got a the number nine  

93
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:06,240
redundantly occurring over and over again 
in these measures okay 6480 turns out to  

94
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:12,000
be a critically important number as well as 
you're going to see as we proceed along here

95
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:22,560
oh and then we have the star tetrahedron which 
would be two tetrahedrons interlaced and i don't  

96
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:31,120
have one of those today but if you can picture 
a tetrahedron like this and then one like this  

97
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:42,560
interlaced it gives you this what's known 
as sometimes the star tetrahedron or the   stellated octahedron it is composed of two 
tetrahedrons each of 720 so here again now  

98
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:48,480
you're seeing the repetition of this same 
number 1440 being the measure of the of the uh  

99
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:54,960
star tetrahedron okay so now we're going to talk 
about time measures the first thing we're going to  

100
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:59,360
look at is astrological time cycles i don't 
know how many of you have studied astrology  

101
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:09,680
but in this particular scheme of time the total 
duration of the processional cycle which is 25  

102
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:20,480
920 years this is the motion of the earth on its 
axis like this or you could think of it like this  

103
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:28,000
the axis of the earth actually forms sort of 
an hourglass motion a long slow period of um  

104
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:35,920
of rotation it's some you could consider earth's 
third motion next to its first motion which is  

105
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:41,279
the daily rotation of the earth on its axis 
its second motion which is the orbit of the  

106
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:48,080
earth around the sun and its third motion 
which is the precession of the earth's axis  

107
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:53,680
the daily the the diurnal or daily rotation of 
the earth on its axis gives us the day-night cycle  

108
00:13:53,680 --> 00:14:00,320
which is obviously of critical importance to our 
life down here on earth the orbit around the sun  

109
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:06,800
also is likewise of critical importance because 
that's the yearly cycle the third motion is what  

110
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:13,680
the ancients refer to as the great ear and it's 
been measured by astronomers at slightly over 50  

111
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:19,760
seconds of arc of motion per year which actually 
puts the astronomically determined number slightly  

112
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:25,280
less than this one but we don't know that that's 
necessarily constant for the whole cycle in any  

113
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:31,600
case the the ancient number that was typically 
attributed to this great year cycle was 25  

114
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:40,160
920 years that great year was considered to 
be analogous to our annual year and just as  

115
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:45,519
the annual year was divided into four seasons 
of spring summer winter and fall likewise the  

116
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:52,000
great year was divided into four great seasons 
symbolized by the four fixed signs of the zodiac  

117
00:14:52,000 --> 00:15:01,920
the bowl the lion the eagle and the man or the 
angel if you divide 25 920 by four to determine  

118
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:08,880
the duration of each season you'll discover that 
it's 6480 years which is interesting because

119
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:20,399
four hundred 6400 eighty years as 
you recall was the total measure   of the dodecahedron so here we 
have this same number linking  

120
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:29,360
the measure of space in terms of the dodecahedron 
6480 degrees and the season of the great year  

121
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:35,200
which was considered to be profoundly 
important to ancient cultures all over the  

122
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:40,960
world who had various ways of representing 
this four-fold division of cyclical time

123
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:55,600
all right then we have from the ancient 
caldeans we have what was known as the   cerro cycle which was 3600 years so we see a 
repetition of that number the 3600 if you re  

124
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:03,440
recalling and are taking notes is the number of 
degrees measuring the icosahedron then we have  

125
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:10,640
the the decans you'll notice that a platonic month 
which is 1 12 1 12 of the great year right there  

126
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:19,120
you divide that number by 12 you get this number 
2160 and that number you may recall depending on

127
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:26,399
how good your memory is is the number of degrees 
measuring the cube two thousand one hundred and  

128
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:32,880
sixty and then you'll notice the two decans of 
the ecliptic is or 20 degrees of the ecliptic  

129
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:39,200
is fourteen hundred and forty the number of 
degrees in the octahedron and one deckhand  

130
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:50,240
or 10 degrees for any of you who've studied 
astrology you know that the deckhands are   important to astrological determinations one 
deckhand of 10 degrees then takes 720 years  

131
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:56,160
and so here we have all five of the platonic 
solids represented in these particular time cycles  

132
00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:02,640
and over here i'm going to mention that 
ancient cultures all over the world used  

133
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:08,800
to run two calendars successfully a secular 
calendar which is typically like our modern  

134
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:14,480
calendar of 365 and one quarter days and then 
they would have a sacred calendar of 360 days  

135
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:20,319
and in five days intercalated they would 
call it typically they would do whether  

136
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:26,480
it was the greeks or the egyptians or even the 
mayans ancient cultures all over the world had  

137
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:33,600
similar uh traditions of setting those five days 
aside and they were considered to be unlucky  

138
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:39,440
and so no really no work no activity nothing 
nobody ever tried to do anything on those days  

139
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:45,360
they would just take those days off five days off 
then they would resume again and pick up their  

140
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:52,080
sacred year of 360 degrees now the sumerians had a 
belief that the year was once actually 360 days in  

141
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:58,080
length and it's somewhere along as a result of 
some cosmic catastrophe of some undefined sort  

142
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:03,840
the day was the year was lengthened by five and 
one quarter days and so the sumerians who are the  

143
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:11,840
first known culture to mathematically divide the 
circle into 360 degrees it is believed that one of  

144
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:16,320
their motives for doing so was they believed that 
that circle then could become a model of the year  

145
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:24,400
and each degree then representing one day so what 
we have now is a synchrony going on in that if the  

146
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:32,480
year the idealized or sacred years 360 days then 
what we have if you actually picture it is that  

147
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:39,200
the earth is describing a circle in its orbit but 
then in each degree of motion around that circle  

148
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:44,480
it's turned once on its axis so what we have 
there is a synchronization of this cosmic motion  

149
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:51,200
representing these numbers so in any case the 
ancient cultures would reckon time measure by  

150
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:57,279
360 days according to the sacred calendar 
and by doing so they could then divide  

151
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:03,919
that 360 days of the sacred year into 
subdivisions such as this right over here  

152
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:10,080
and we'll just run through that very quickly 
you'll notice that one deckhand turns out to  

153
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:17,360
be 10 days within the sacred calendar and that's 
exactly 14 400 minutes so here we have the same  

154
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:24,080
numbers recurring again you'll notice though that 
the number the symbolism of the number is not lost  

155
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:31,920
or the system of the the symbolism of the 
number is consistent irrespective of its  

156
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:39,120
order of magnitude so in other words you could say 
the square of 12 being 144 has the same symbolism  

157
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:48,720
as 144 times 10 or 144 times 100 as you have right 
here or even 144 times a thousand again referring  

158
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:56,480
back to the book of revelations there's a verse 
in there uh referring to the 144 000 redeemed of  

159
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:02,559
the earth and we'll get to that uh here shortly 
that's an interesting quote because they have  

160
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:08,320
various ways of embedding these sacred numbers 
into the into the various traditions you'll notice  

161
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:16,240
that three decades or one platonic month in the 
platonic year was 2160 years but in the sacred  

162
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:26,160
year of 360 days again there's that 43 200. so and 
go down here the one platonic season of 6480 years  

163
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:31,919
129 600. so if you're taking notes and writing 
these down you're going to find it you're  

164
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:37,040
writing down the same numbers over and over again 
simply raised to different orders of magnitude

165
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:46,480
okay this is just a little graphic that depicts 
this processional motion that i'm talking about  

166
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:53,679
here this motion right here that is generally 
assumed by most astronomers to be primarily  

167
00:20:53,680 --> 00:21:01,040
induced onto the earth by by the moon secondarily 
by the sun and then also a contributing factor by  

168
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:06,240
the planets so it's almost you could almost think 
of this processional motion of the earth's axis  

169
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:12,080
as being the uh the vector summation of 
all the gravity forces of the solar system  

170
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:19,200
acting on the earth causing it acting see when 
the planet rotates on its axis and this is a  

171
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:25,360
critically uh critical factor 
as it rotates on its axis  

172
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:33,440
it spreads out towards the middle its equatorial 
diameter is greater than its polar diameter and  

173
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:39,840
that in fact is critical to the earth 
maintaining uh axial stability so that  

174
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:45,360
it's not doing this in its orbit around the sun 
because if it was doing that uh it's likely that  

175
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:50,640
higher life would have never evolved in the 
first place but due to the fact that it spins  

176
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:58,080
it spreads out so that the diameter of the equator 
is 26 miles greater than the diameter of the pole  

177
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:03,760
the sum total of all the gravity forces impinging 
upon the earth from moon sun and planets  

178
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:10,160
acts upon that bulge as if it was a flywheel and 
is actually pulling it around pulling it around  

179
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:16,400
and it's that that that leads to the great year 
and uh what it does is over a period of half the  

180
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:23,200
great year one million or uh 12 960 years is it 
reverses the seasons so that if we were able to  

181
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:30,639
jump in a time machine and go back 12 960 or ahead 
12960 we would find that everything was reversed  

182
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:36,160
if we would keep the same gregorian calendar in 
place the seasons would have been reversed so that  

183
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:41,440
winter would be july and summer would be in fact 
and then what we would see is that hemispherically  

184
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:52,320
like we know that when it's winter in the northern 
hemisphere it's southern it's summer in the   southern hemisphere well those seasons would be 
reversed they flip it's a back and forth it's an  

185
00:22:52,320 --> 00:23:00,320
oscillation between uh the two hemispheres of 
the earth over a period of of of 12 960 years  

186
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:07,200
this shows that the wheel of the great year 
with all of the ages the astrological months as  

187
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:12,480
they're known and if we were to place ourselves 
right at this position right here where it says  

188
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:23,600
zero years bp bp means before present and it also 
is 25 920 years so what has been happening is  

189
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:32,080
that the vernal equinox the oppo a hypothetical 
point in space occupied by the sun when day and  

190
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:40,080
night or the exact same duration that vernal 
point is moving through space as a result of  

191
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:48,399
this axial motion of the earth and ancient 
peoples would go to great lengths to try to  

192
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:57,840
observe and predict that motion so they would set 
up structures oftentimes on a very large scale  

193
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:04,720
that would be oriented to certain points in space 
so that one could from certain vantage points such  

194
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:10,480
as the center of a ringed megalithic structure 
for example or the center of a temple that had  

195
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:19,120
an axial orientation to a certain point on the 
horizon one could make my new observations of this  

196
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:26,640
slowly shifting uh vernal equinox or for example 
the solstices the vernal equinox and the solstices  

197
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:32,240
are two lines in space that are right angles to 
each other i'll show you a graphic in a minute  

198
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:38,640
but in any case as we go around this wheel this 
great wheel here this wheel of this cosmic wheel  

199
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:45,920
what we're going to see is that each of these is 
a zodiacal sign we have here pisces we have here  

200
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:53,440
aquarius so now the vernal equinox is poised 
it's it's moving out of the star constellation of  

201
00:24:54,000 --> 00:25:04,080
pisces moving into the star 
constellation of aquarius   and so we say that roughly for the last 
2000 or if we want to be precise 2160 years  

202
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:17,519
the vernal equinox has been transiting the 
constellation of pisces and therefore we've   been in the piscean age prior to that was aries 
prior to that was taurus we find that the uh the  

203
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:23,360
beginning of modern recorded history goes back to 
the taurian age we can essentially express all of  

204
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:29,279
recorded human history between the 
the latter part of the taurian age  

205
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:34,400
through the age of aries the age of pisces 
and now into the age of aquarius right

206
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:42,880
okay if we go back we'll notice though that 
the numbers here are the same numbers the same  

207
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:53,440
family of numbers we've been looking at here 
2160 4320 6480 8640 10800 we saw the number  

208
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:59,440
108 i called your attention to that when i was 
asking you what was the atomic weight of silver  

209
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:06,800
and which metal i mean which which 
astronomical object is silver associated with  

210
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:14,880
the moon yes 12 960 puts us 
exactly on the opposite end of the  

211
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:22,480
equinoctial axis and then we see it right angles 
to each other we have this is the autumn spring  

212
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:32,560
axis and this is the summer winter axis and 
they're at right angles to each other and   the whole thing is rotating you've got a picture 
that this propeller is rotating counterclockwise  

213
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:45,200
so that in 6480 years taurus will be 
have moved down to the zero point okay  

214
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:52,240
we've seen this so this is just a recap of 
those same numbers and you will notice 8640  

215
00:26:52,240 --> 00:27:00,320
the number of seconds in one day you'll notice 
that in a half a day 43 200 well if you go back to  

216
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:07,039
the dawning of the age of aries 
three hundred and twenty years ago

217
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:16,080
and these are just more interesting ways 
that these numbers show up if you take  

218
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:25,680
twenty five thousand nine hundred 
twenty seconds and set each each   second corresponding to one year of the great 
year you'll discover it's exactly 432 minutes  

219
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:41,520
25 920 hours in turn is 1080 days and 25 920 days 
is equal to 72 years in the sacred calendar which  

220
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:47,120
is interesting because i think if you most uh 
determinations of the average human lifespan  

221
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:53,600
right now in history is about 72 years 
so you could think of a human lifespan  

222
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:58,799
as being equivalent to one day of the great year 
there's an interesting proportional relationship  

223
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:07,280
going on there between the total processional 
cycle of 25 920 years and one human lifetime

224
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:17,120
in the vedas they had various ways 
of encoding uh references to numbers  

225
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:25,280
let the brahman hear the praise we utter 
this has the four-horned buffalo emitted  

226
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:31,279
four are his horns three are the feet that 
bear him his heads are two his hands are  

227
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:38,480
seven in number notice four three two raised 
to the seventh power gives you the number of  

228
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:45,120
years in the ancient vedic time span the culpa 
4 billion 320 million years which i find to be  

229
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:50,240
suspiciously close to the modern estimate for the 
age of the universe which is about four and a half  

230
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:56,080
or the age of the earth rather which is about four 
and a half billion years so this was one way they  

231
00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:01,200
had of encoding or embedding references to these 
sacred numbers in the vedas and this is probably  

232
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:07,919
some of the oldest writings that extent where 
these this canon of numerology is is presented  

233
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:15,600
in ancient samaria from the various writings of 
historians like um barossas and others and from  

234
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:20,400
the sumerian clay tablets were able 
to find that there were references to  

235
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:26,960
ten pre or anti-diluvian kings 
what does uh pre deluvian mean  

236
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:34,000
before the flood right so they had this belief 
that there were ten kings raining before the flood  

237
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:40,240
and you'll notice the numbers that they ascribed 
to each of the kings the rain uh those numbers  

238
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:46,240
now should all be becoming familiar to you you've 
seen a bunch of them already there's forty three  

239
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:51,360
thousand two hundred sixty four eight hundred 
thirty six you'll notice sixty four thousand  

240
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:58,559
eight hundred is uh presented twice actually three 
times the total low forty four hundred and thirty  

241
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:05,040
two thousand years um that's a long span of time 
do you think they meant this literally or is this  

242
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:11,680
strictly symbolic and figurative is it possible 
that the king could have reigned for 36 000 years  

243
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:17,919
i tend to think it was symbolical but you know it 
is interesting that one of the again one of the  

244
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:23,680
universal traditions from ancient cultures is that 
before the flood in all the cultures from all over  

245
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:32,240
the world recognized that there was a great flood 
or even floods that decimated humanity at various  

246
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:44,240
times but they're all pretty much in agreement 
that prior to the flood the human lifespan was   much longer than it is today which i find we've 
all heard about methuselah living to be 969 years  

247
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:51,920
right or lamech being 777. it seems that they had 
in the biblical ages they seem to have lived about  

248
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:59,040
an order of magnitude greater than our modern ages 
which considering you know from my perspective  

249
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:03,840
the things i'd like to get done in this 
lifetime i would need at least that many years

250
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:12,800
in the value piranha which is again one of 
the vedas we find verses like this 360 years  

251
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:19,120
according to the human calculation constitute 
one divine year wise people know that there  

252
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:25,360
are four yugas in bharata varsa the first 
one is krata then follow trata devapara  

253
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:30,720
and kali probably some of you have heard of the 
kali yuga that we're supposedly in right now  

254
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:35,440
and suppose the age of darkness 
and the age of ignorance

255
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:43,520
but you'll notice that they they reckon 
time they have a they have another the  

256
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:51,680
vedas recognizes a sacred year that they call 
or a divine year which is 360 of our years  

257
00:31:53,520 --> 00:32:00,320
okay now here's a tabulation of the vedic ages 
and you'll notice we'll look first at the total  

258
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:05,600
in human years and we see that the 
kali yuga the shortest is 432 thousand  

259
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:12,960
then we go to 864 thousand one million two hundred 
ninety six thousand one million seven hundred  

260
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:24,160
twenty eight and four million three hundred 
and twenty thousand you'll notice that the   total or the maha yuga the great yuga is 
ten times the length of the kali yuga and uh  

261
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:36,240
that's because you'll notice that that 
the drapara is twice the trade is three   times and the sake is four times so taking the 
original term doubling it then tripling it then  

262
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:42,400
quadrupling it adding those together will give 
us 10 times the number we started with but again  

263
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:49,280
notice the number that the vedic ages 
begins with 432 000 is the same number  

264
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:56,559
that the sumerian king list ends with so it's 
almost as if we have two different traditions but  

265
00:32:56,560 --> 00:33:03,680
one system and we see that the sumerians preserve 
knowledge about the the um subdivisions of this  

266
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:12,160
yuga time of 432 thousand years and symbolize 
these subdivisions by the reigns of these these 10  

267
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:20,640
uh prediluvian kings and then we can see that once 
we get to 432 000 years at that point the vedic  

268
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:31,360
cycles kick in and then we have these that follow 
and using the divine year of 360 years yields  

269
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:37,280
these this column of numbers and then when we put 
the duration into human years it's interesting  

270
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:42,640
each each of the yugas such as the kali yuga 
they were all believed to have a a period  

271
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:48,800
of transition into the age then the age itself 
and then a period of transition out of the age  

272
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:56,480
and so basically what they did was they took the 
the total age you'll notice here the relationship  

273
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:03,120
between the kali yugas the 360 thousand and 
the sanja which was the transition in the  

274
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:10,159
sun yamsa which was the transition out are each 
one tenth of that adding up to the total of 432  

275
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:17,119
but you'll notice that we we're we've got the same 
recurring numbers again now there's 144 000 right  

276
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:22,399
there and then we have that raised by another 
order of magnitude so you see how these same  

277
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:29,599
numbers are recurring over and over again uh and i 
would suggest that there's a pattern emerging here  

278
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:36,319
and i know that for a lot of people first time 
they are confronted with this kind of information  

279
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:45,759
sometimes it's almost too mind-boggling you're 
going what the heck is all these numbers mean   uh you know it's just too many numbers to 
sort out but what you realize once you start  

280
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:56,720
studying them is that each one of them is 
kind of a mnemonic because each number has   a whole collection of phenomena that's associated 
with it and it's still in use today i mean how  

281
00:34:56,720 --> 00:35:04,000
many people i mean everybody should know that 
you know a square foot is 144 square inches i  

282
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:09,760
mean anybody who's a builder a craftsperson an 
artist should know basic rules of measurement  

283
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:17,840
the mayan world ages now you notice there 
do we see similar numbers the buck tune  

284
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:24,559
144 000 days so it's almost like they took the 
same they had the same numbers but they're now  

285
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:31,680
representing smaller cycles but it's the same 
numbers representing the cyclical periods within  

286
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:37,920
nature a tune is 360 days and that was the 
typical that was the sacred calendar that we  

287
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:43,839
find all over the ancient world and then they had 
the five days added to that the five unlucky days  

288
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:50,880
so again we see the same numbers being repeated 
redundantly throughout these various traditions

289
00:35:53,760 --> 00:36:03,760
sacred numbers embedded in solar 
system architecture i'm only going   to show you a few examples of this to 
convey to you the idea the solar orb

290
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:16,960
well if we measure that we discover its   radius is 432 000 miles which of course 
means that its diameter is 864 000 miles  

291
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:22,960
so notice that we measured the sun according 
to the human measure of miles and by the way um  

292
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:30,079
what is the origin of the the mile unit 
that we use anybody know origin of the mile  

293
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:36,000
origin of the mile it comes from the 
latin word mill which means a thousand  

294
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:41,200
so it's talking about a thousand something 
what would it be talking about a thousand what  

295
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:54,000
a thousand paces that average 5.28 feet in length 
it actually goes back we know that romans were  

296
00:36:54,000 --> 00:37:00,720
using a mile there were a thousand paces and they 
would lay out rome for example had a city center  

297
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:07,680
and everything was measured outwards from that 
city center according to paces and those paces  

298
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:12,720
were um a thousand of them gave the roman 
mile the roman pace was a little bit shorter  

299
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:18,320
than the british pace which is where we get our 
mile from our mile in fact interestingly and  

300
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:25,760
i'm going to show you a diagram of this shortly 
uh stonehenge is 105 the the outer ring of the  

301
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:33,680
sarsonstone circle measures right at about 105.6 
feet which makes its one-fifth of a mile or one  

302
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:40,960
150th of a mile i'm sorry that and several other 
numbers that we find in megalithic structures in  

303
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:51,520
ancient england suggest that the mile was actually 
a unit of measure that was being used as long ago   as four thousand years or longer and we're still 
using it today the same unit of measure that  

304
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:59,040
could have been used 4 000 years ago and for that 
reason um you know i there and once you begin to  

305
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:05,440
get into and understand um the sacred basis of 
our ancient meteorological or measuring systems  

306
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:10,880
you'll realize that if we convert completely over 
to the metric system we're going to lose something  

307
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:18,160
very very profound all right remember what was 
the length of the kali yuga 432 000 years what  

308
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:25,520
was the length of the dopara yuga 864 000 years 
what was the length of a platonic month 1 12th of  

309
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:34,080
the great year anybody remember 2160 years right 
the same number of degrees that measure the cube

310
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:45,840
all right what are we looking at here 
anybody recognize that look familiar

311
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:55,680
the moon has a radius of 1080 miles which gives 
it a diameter of 2160. remember i said that  

312
00:38:56,240 --> 00:39:05,119
1080 or 108 and it's double 2160 was a lunar 
number see this is a clue to you now there are  

313
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:11,680
several references for example um in the sumerian 
tradition describing the ark built by zizithrus  

314
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:16,880
which is being described as a cube that makes no 
sense you think what kind of a ship is it that  

315
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:23,279
would be described as a cube you know it wouldn't 
be very seaworthy a cube right but it's not  

316
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:29,200
referring to an actual ship as we think of it it's 
referring to the cubing of the sphere and in this  

317
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:34,560
case the sphere that it's referring to is the moon 
which was symbolically considered to be an arc  

318
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:41,200
to many of the ancient cultures that believed 
that the earth was periodically destroyed by great  

319
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:50,640
catastrophes so we have the number 1080 and we 
have the number 2160. and then we have the earth

320
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:59,359
you know that's the earth and again because 
of the spinning of the earth on its axis  

321
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:07,600
we have this difference between the polar diameter 
78.99 or just thinking round number 7900 miles  

322
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:15,920
and the equatorial diameter 7926 so that 
creates a 26 mile difference and thank  

323
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:20,960
thank you for that 26 mile difference because 
life on earth would be a very chaotic affair  

324
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:28,160
without that bulge we see that the diameter of 
a sphere with the same surface area as earth is  

325
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:36,880
7920 miles and also the diameter of the earth 
when you take it from if you slice it through  

326
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:44,319
the tropic of cancer through to the tropic of 
capricorn that diameter also is about 7 920  

327
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:49,920
so we use 7920 as the sacred number 
to represent the earth because  

328
00:40:51,120 --> 00:41:02,720
even though the earth varies considerably 
between equatorial and polar diameters   we find that at a very significant piercing 
through of the earth's diameter from one tropic  

329
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:09,280
to the other tropic turns out to be 7900 miles 
we also find that if we take a perfect sphere  

330
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:14,720
that has a the same area the same 
surface area as the earth actually has  

331
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:21,840
its diameter would be 7920 miles so 
that's the number we use for the earth

332
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:29,440
which means that its radius is half 
that or 3960. and in most books you read  

333
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:41,200
astronomy and so forth when 
they're talking in round numbers   about the radius of the diameter of the earth 
these are the numbers they use 79 20 and

334
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:54,080
and 39.60 okay now what i've got here is 
evidence for advanced geodetic knowledge  

335
00:41:54,720 --> 00:42:01,680
in archaic times what is geo what is geodesy or 
geodetic knowledge geodesy is the determination  

336
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:06,800
of the size and the shape of the earth early 
in the 19th century such knowledge was acquired  

337
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:12,880
by extensive land surveying and triangulating 
over large tracts of the earth's surface since  

338
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:19,200
the 1970s orbital satellites have provided the 
most accurate picture of the earth's exact size  

339
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:26,320
and mass distribution any advanced comprehension 
of the larger picture of our planet as a suitable  

340
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:34,480
abode for the evolution of higher life requires 
knowledge of its size and shape the total mass  

341
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:40,800
of course determines g the gravitational constant 
the equatorial bulge is an integral component of  

342
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:47,760
the forces acting to impose rotation and orbital 
stability on earth as it wheels about the sun  

343
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:53,760
the relevance of these two basic factors to 
the evolution of life cannot be underestimated  

344
00:42:54,720 --> 00:43:00,080
ancient master builders understood earth's 
fundamental geodetic parameters on a level  

345
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:08,640
not equaled until the advent of modern satellite 
surveys how do we know that well probably the most  

346
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:14,880
salient means we have of knowing that is the 
great pyramid of chiops itself and there's been  

347
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:20,880
lots and lots of speculation about what the form 
or what the function of the great pyramid was some  

348
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:28,720
of it to me is is pretty pretty out there some 
of it i think is pretty abstract and speculative  

349
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:34,880
what i've always thought does make the most 
sense and has the greatest credibility is the  

350
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:40,160
pyramid is essentially a model of the earth the 
northern hemisphere and i'll show you how here  

351
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:51,040
the thing you have to understand when you're 
looking at the measurement of the earth in   terms of its size and shape is that we have lines 
everybody knows latitude and longitude latitude  

352
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:55,440
is measured north and south of the equator 
longitude is the measure around this way

353
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:09,599
parallels are lines that run 
hor the parallel to the equator   and traveling along one of the parallels we 
would be displacing ourselves longitudinally  

354
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:16,080
but parallels actually measure you can see the 
this parallel here this is probably the arctic  

355
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:22,800
circle it looks to me like about 66 and a half 
degrees north so it is parallel to the equator  

356
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:28,880
right so depending on what parallel you are 
every line of latitude north and south has  

357
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:39,359
a corresponding parallel and you know that from 
the equator to the north pole is going to be 90   degrees and likewise from the equator to the south 
pole is going to be 90 degrees of arc then in turn  

358
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:46,080
we have meridian lines which are lines that run 
north south but actually measured distances east  

359
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:51,280
and west so that if you travel from one meridian 
to the next to another meridian you would have  

360
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:57,680
traveled from east to west every point on the 
surface of the earth has a local meridian we  

361
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:03,200
have a local meridian here and it's basically the 
way you would find it is if you walked out here i  

362
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:09,520
believe this is generally south isn't it this way 
so if we went out here and we looked exactly south  

363
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:17,600
and exactly north and then the zenith overhead 
the point 90 degrees up from a flat horizon  

364
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:24,560
and we struck an arc from the south point through 
the zenith point to the north pole that arc would  

365
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:31,920
be our local meridian and as the earth turns under 
that local meridian we measure all astronomical  

366
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:38,000
motion relative to our point on the surface of 
the earth with respect to that local meridian now  

367
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:45,839
you'll notice that as you go through the parallels 
the parallels form virtually perfect circles

368
00:45:50,560 --> 00:46:00,880
the meridian lines on the other hand are 
not circles because of the flattening   of the earth because of the expansion of the 
equator if you draw a line around it this way

369
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:13,600
this way and cut the earth this way it is not 
going to be a circle if you cut it this way it   will be a circle okay that creates very subtle 
differences in geometry when you're measuring  

370
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:19,200
a meridian line north to south what happens is 
that as you travel north away from the equator  

371
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:26,880
if you were going on a perfect sphere then 
each degree of latitude north would have the  

372
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:32,799
same distance but it's not a perfect sphere it's 
flattened so as you're moving towards the north  

373
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:38,160
pole the earth is actually flattening out the 
earth's radius is shrinking so it's flattening  

374
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:46,319
out what that means is that to to traverse a 
degree of arc you have to travel further as  

375
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:53,040
you get away from the equator towards the north 
pole okay i'm i'm explaining this because you've  

376
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:58,400
got to understand this to see how the ancients 
actually understood how they demonstrated to us  

377
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:08,640
that they understood the size and shape of 
the earth with a high degree of accuracy   so again parallels are going to be in circles and 
you're going to notice that the biggest circle is  

378
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:14,880
going to be the equatorial circle and as you 
travel towards the the poles those circles get  

379
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:21,200
smaller in size so therefore if you took the 
meridian lines which would be the dotted lines  

380
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:29,680
the distance between say one degree of meridians 
at the equator is going to be greater than that  

381
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:36,160
distance between the same two meridians say at our 
latitude here in atlanta which is about 34 degrees  

382
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:42,960
north or further north as you travel further north 
those meridian lines converge until you get to the  

383
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:51,040
north pole and then they they meet each other and 
have zero distance between them okay this is taken  

384
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:55,680
out of the smithsonian meteorological tables and 
what we're looking at here without belaboring this  

385
00:47:56,320 --> 00:48:03,520
is you'll notice latitude 0 degrees and you go 
through up to 90 degrees and what this is showing  

386
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:09,520
is if we look in the statute miles right there 
this says length of one degree of the meridian  

387
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:17,920
so this is the line from equator up to the north 
pole well if you look at the first number which  

388
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:22,960
let's see if we can zoom in a little here 
you'll notice that at zero when you travel  

389
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:28,080
leave the equator and go to the first degree 
north latitude you've gone 68.703 miles  

390
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:35,200
but if you look down here at the very last one 
when you traverse that last degree from 89 and you  

391
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:43,760
finally get to the north pole you've traveled 69.4 
miles so those degrees have stretched out okay  

392
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:49,519
now this is important to understand how 
the ancients were able to demonstrate  

393
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:54,400
to future generations that they understood 
the size and the shape of the earth

394
00:48:56,720 --> 00:49:08,640
and then we have one length of one degree of the 
parallel if you notice right there i don't know   if you can read it from out there but that says 
69.172 miles so think of a circle going around the  

395
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:17,279
earth's equator you've traveled one degree one 360 
of that distance around you've gone 69.172 miles  

396
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:23,760
let's go halfway up from equator to north pole 
which would be 45 degrees and you see right there  

397
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:29,360
you've gone 49 miles then when you get up 
to the pole itself when you're one degree  

398
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:36,400
away from the north pole you only have to go 1.2 
miles because those meridian lines have converged  

399
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:42,079
so now the thing to grasp here is that if we're 
measuring the size and the shape of the earth  

400
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:46,640
that's going to vary depending on where on 
the earth we're making those measurements  

401
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:59,920
this is important because what we 
discover is that the ancient peoples   knew this and incorporated into their architecture 
so that they would derive units of measurement  

402
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:06,080
that were ultimately based upon the size and 
shape of the earth where the structure was  

403
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:12,720
being built now let's take the most prominent 
one before we get to that this is geodetic data  

404
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:19,280
and you'll notice here we've got going back 
to 1830 which was the first attempt in modern  

405
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:26,000
times to determine the size and shape of the 
earth and let's go since that's meters let's go  

406
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:30,080
to something we'll recognize miles 
we're talking about the radius here  

407
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:36,640
and you'll notice as you're coming down through 
here we get to these last two world grid system  

408
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:43,359
72 and geodetic reference system 80 are the two 
that were determined by satellite measurements  

409
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:54,800
and you'll notice that as we come through 
here we've got a polar radius in miles and n   equatorial radius in miles and then we have 
the difference in the two radii right here  

410
00:50:55,440 --> 00:51:04,880
and we assume that as we've come through 
we're progressively getting better and   better at measuring the size and shape of the 
earth and finally with satellite measurements  

411
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:13,440
we're getting down here and we've determined 
that the polar radius for example 3949.8934

412
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:20,240
3949.8948 what does that 
translate into well let's see  

413
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:28,880
in terms of feet that's a difference 
of uh oh 250 feet roughly between um

414
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:50,160
yeah between these two measurements in 
other words between the first satellite   measurement and 72 in the second one in in 
1980 the difference was about 250 feet safe  

415
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:56,240
the history of man may be far longer and stranger 
than we think the great pyramid may indeed not  

416
00:51:56,240 --> 00:52:02,240
fit in with what we believe about the past and 
the nature of the world thousands of years ago  

417
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:13,920
someone measured the earth with remarkable 
accuracy and recorded this information in   the dimensions of the largest and possibly the 
oldest stone building on the planet william r fix

418
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:24,000
generally the age of the pyramid 
is given around 4 200 years   it's roughly about the same age as the sphinx

419
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:32,480
some of you are probably familiar with the however 
the re-dating of the sphinx by several geologists  

420
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:38,240
primarily robert shock from boston university 
who has studied the weathering of the limestone  

421
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:45,600
composing the sphinx and the surrounding quarry 
that the sphinx is situated in and has determined  

422
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:53,360
that the uh that the rock has been severely 
weathered by water erosion and of course this giza  

423
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:59,520
plateau has been desert for the last 4 000 years 
so it's not likely you're going to find severe  

424
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:05,440
water erosion on the sphinx if it's only 4 000 
years old in fact so severe is the water erosion  

425
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:12,320
that it's likely that the sphinx is probably tens 
of thousands of years old however robert shock  

426
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:22,240
in most of his public presentations 
usually places it at seven to nine   thousand years but he's totally personally he 
just uses that because he's deliberately being  

427
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:27,600
very conservative because he's in the academic 
community but he's perfectly willing to believe  

428
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:34,080
that it is could be much older than that and i've 
discussed the the extent of the water erosion  

429
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:41,280
with him and discovered that he actually hasn't 
looked uh in depth at the uh comparable studies of  

430
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:47,360
rates of limestone weathering which i 
spent a couple of months about 10 years ago  

431
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:57,200
studying going around the various places 
where there were limestones and where   you could see examples of limestone that 
had been weathered and had looked at um  

432
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:08,560
read the literature that had been done on 
limestone weathering it had concluded that   you know would be a minimum of 20 000 years worth 
of weathering and that's a minimum if you took the  

433
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:14,880
sphinx and set it in a climate with rainfall like 
say we've been having for the last three months  

434
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:20,240
which would average out to about 45 inches a 
year even with rainfall like we've been seeing  

435
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:26,240
here in atlanta in the last three months it would 
take the sphinx a minimum of 20 to 30 000 years to  

436
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:33,600
get the level of erosion that raises the question 
regarding the great pyramid could it be as old  

437
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:42,000
and i see no reason why not problem here though is 
you know that the great pyramid was once covered  

438
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:47,920
in white limestone casing stones highly polished 
and according to arabic traditions pretty much all  

439
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:54,480
the arabic traditions and legends about the great 
pyramid concur that the outside of the pyramid  

440
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:59,200
prior to the stripping of the casing stones 
was covered completely covered in hieroglyphs  

441
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:06,000
and one it just boggles one's mind to contemplate 
what might have been written here but clearly  

442
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:11,120
i have a hard time imagining a greater act of 
vandalism in all of history than the stripping  

443
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:16,160
of those stones in fact there had been efforts 
to get into the pyramid up until the time of  

444
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:22,720
alma moon which was i think around 1200 a.d 
but they were completely ineffectual and then  

445
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:31,760
somewhere around the 12th century i forgot 
the exact year there was a great earthquake   in northern egypt and it caused most 
of the buildings in cairo to collapse  

446
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:38,640
and it also loosened some of the casing stones on 
the pyramid which allowed them to get in and pry  

447
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:45,840
those stones loose from the top and all of the 
stones were then stripped off and that high  

448
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:53,839
indirect high quality limestone was stripped off 
and recarved and used in buildings to rebuild  

449
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:58,800
cairo so i've often thought there's probably 
temples somewhere in cairo where maybe  

450
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:04,960
some of those original stones are still to be 
found with inscriptions intact of course i have  

451
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:11,760
no idea but i oftentimes thought wouldn't that 
be cool anyways they stripped off the stones  

452
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:21,200
and as they stripped them off there 
was a lot of rubble that fell down   and buried the bottom of the pyramid which 
turned out to be a good thing because it buried  

453
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:28,640
the bottom casing stones from those bottom and 
preserved and so from those you know the various  

454
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:41,040
researchers could determine what the original 
exact angle of the pyramid was and according   to most calculations it was around 51 degrees 51 
minutes 14 seconds i don't know if that level of  

455
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:47,440
accuracy is is credible or not but 51 minutes 
51 degrees 51 minutes would be and from there  

456
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:57,200
we can then determine what the geometry of the 
pyramid would have been and what its original   height would have been simply by taking the 
tangent of of that angle 51 degrees 51 minutes  

457
00:56:57,200 --> 00:57:07,280
and knowing the base length one could calculate 
what the original height would have been to a   high degree of accuracy so that's been done by 
oh four or five different people over the years  

458
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:13,760
j.h cole in 1925 did what's considered to be 
the definitive survey of the great pyramid  

459
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:18,880
he was a professional survey who did a very 
meticulous survey after they had just cleared  

460
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:24,240
away all of the rubble and he had access to 
it he did it under contract to the to the  

461
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:29,760
government of egypt the numbers that i'm about to 
show you here are mostly derived from his survey  

462
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:36,800
so what we have here is here's some of the 
original casing stones and they sit on a  

463
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:42,800
what's called a sockle which is this base which 
was measured to be 55 centimeters in thickness  

464
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:49,040
and of course you got to bear in mind that 
this original slope casing stone there was  

465
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:57,200
not it wasn't stepped like that originally it was 
a smooth profile and let me okay so here you have  

466
00:57:57,200 --> 00:58:02,400
course here you see that the casing stones were 
damaged by the rubble falling down but enough of  

467
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:14,320
them were still intact that one could make this 
accurate determination of the original angle   here's the sockle which is 55 centimeters thick 
and it sits directly on bedrock so it actually  

468
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:24,480
what it does is it creates two ways that one 
could measure the height of the pyramid either   with or without the sockle there's also two ways 
of measuring the base this is a reconstruction  

469
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:33,920
from a 1991 work on uh pharonic stone masonry 
and this shows that outside the corners  

470
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:41,119
which was the the core masonry there are these 
sockets and i found one picture showing a socket  

471
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:51,440
this is showing one of the sockets that's 
still there that sits outside the core masonry   but based on those sockets they were able to 
reconstruct what the original base of the pyramid  

472
00:58:51,440 --> 00:59:01,920
would have looked like so here would have been the 
51 degrees 51 minutes coming down sitting on the   55 centimeter thick sockle here like this well 
what this did was it gave two ways of measuring  

473
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:12,880
the perimeter of the pyramid's base one 
could be measured from this point up on   top of the circle the other could be measured 
from down here that included the saw so what  

474
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:19,680
you ended up with was two ways of measuring the 
pyramid's base well which one was the correct one  

475
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:32,160
well they were both correct i think that they were 
actually intending to embody in there that there   were two ways of measuring uh the pyramids base 
so what we have is the length of the base on the  

476
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:41,200
sockle which is the shorter of the two up there 
it was varied from side to side you'll notice 755  

477
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:48,880
at the smallest to 756 just over at the largest 
so there was some variation there was probably  

478
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:54,160
a reason for that variation actually but we won't 
get into that because it just gets too technical  

479
00:59:54,160 --> 01:00:00,000
for what we're talking about today but the total 
of those measured around the four sides would be

480
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:06,720
3023.139 feet if you're taking notes 
that'd be a good number to write down  

481
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:14,000
okay so now let's see what the measure is 
around that includes the cycle or the base  

482
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:22,640
and we see that it's each side is a roughly five 
feet longer 760 to 761 each side again is a little  

483
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:32,559
different but we get a total of 3043.43 feet okay 
so i'm going to over here i'm going to write down  

484
01:00:32,560 --> 01:00:45,840
a few numbers that we saw through our radius of 
the moon diameter of the moon radius of the sun

485
01:00:48,080 --> 01:01:01,600
diameter of the sun number of seconds in a day would be 432 000 43 
200 uh number of seconds and a half a day number  

486
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:11,040
of seconds in a full day 86 400 what were some of 
our more other numbers oh yeah 14 40 was 1 79 20  

487
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:24,559
diameter of the earth just so they're up 
there in front of you we can refer to them   as we go on here all right so here is 
profile the great pyramid with a 51 degree  

488
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:32,160
51 minute angle i've just to make it easy i've 
just rounded off the numbers 481 feet in height  

489
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:41,520
that would be not including 
the the sockle the base 755.85 i just picked one to use

490
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:51,040
and there's our 51 degree 51 minute angle 
and we find that when we measure measure it  

491
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:57,440
this way it turns out to be almost exactly 11 
over 7. there's some other interesting geometry  

492
01:01:57,440 --> 01:02:06,000
going on related to the golden section 
which i don't intend to get into today   because it makes more sense if you're actually 
studying sacred geometry and you're familiar  

493
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:11,520
and you've made these drawings because in a sacred 
geometry class just like in the old pythagorean  

494
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:16,800
platonic lodges we draw we draw we draw and 
then we eventually build models and that's  

495
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:20,880
the way to really get familiar with this and 
get these numbers as part of your consciousness  

496
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:37,760
so i'm not going to get into the 
connection with the golden section today   when we measure including the cycle this becomes 
our height 482.7575 feet and the base 760.9 feet  

497
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:42,400
okay those are the numbers we're 
going to look at for a second here now

498
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:48,560
if we look at these these are various 
estimates we're we're looking at  

499
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:57,200
this one right here the coal height estimate 
plus the cycle at 21.6 inches gives a total  

500
01:02:57,200 --> 01:03:05,680
of the height above bedrock of 
482.757 feet so now we're going to go  

501
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:12,880
back to the earth so we can see how these 
numbers link the two we take one square degree  

502
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:19,599
of latitude and longitude at the equator pretend 
we're standing at the equator okay we know  

503
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:29,360
that the polar radius now is 13 miles less than 
the equatorial radius so what that means is that  

504
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:34,400
the circle this way is shorter than the circle 
the biggest circle that defines the earth is  

505
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:40,240
the equatorial circle so a degree of measure 
on the equator is going to be the biggest  

506
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:48,240
the longest of any degree we measure anywhere 
on the earth the equator okay the north-south is  

507
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:58,320
going to be a little bit shorter and you'll notice 
right there we've got 68.7 miles north to south  

508
01:03:58,320 --> 01:04:07,440
and 69.17 east to west so it's not a perfectly 
square unit is it it's a little bit distorted  

509
01:04:08,320 --> 01:04:12,880
well that distortion is totally 
significant because it's that distortion  

510
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:23,200
that is a measure of the earth's 
departure from being a perfect sphere   and it's that departure of a perfect sphere that 
is very significant to us because without that  

511
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:31,760
again earth's orbital stability wouldn't be would 
be non-existent okay so we're going to divide this  

512
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:40,320
up a little bit if we take this square degree 
of of latitude north to south longitude east to  

513
01:04:40,320 --> 01:04:50,880
west and we look very carefully down in the 
lower right hand corner you're going to see   something a little square you see that little 
square that represents one minute one sixtieth  

514
01:04:51,840 --> 01:05:00,480
of the degree this way 1 60 of the degree this way 
so that's one minute of latitude and longitude all  

515
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:06,080
right we're going to take a closer look 
at that and we will see that one minute  

516
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:17,359
then is 6045.881 north to south 6087 east to west 
which is what we expect the east west should be  

517
01:05:17,360 --> 01:05:25,280
a little bit longer and that's one square minute 
of latitude and longitude okay now we're going to  

518
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:33,440
divide each of those lengths into two we're going 
to divide our square minute into 1 4 sections and  

519
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:44,559
here's what i want you to notice when we do 
that we take one-fourth of a square minute of   latitude and longitude look at our dimension east 
to west and look at our dimension north to south

520
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:49,839
and look at these two numbers

521
01:05:52,160 --> 01:06:02,000
in fact here's here's an accurate calculation 
we take the 482.755 feet which is the height  

522
01:06:03,040 --> 01:06:15,520
and what we discover is that if we multiply that 
by the number 4 43 200 which is one of our sacred  

523
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:21,920
numbers that we've seen right there forty three 
thousand two hundred it shows up in the vedas  

524
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:29,680
in the sumerian king lists etc etc if we multiply 
the height of the pyramid by that number this is  

525
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:38,400
what we come out with 3949.83 miles and notice 
the difference between the pyramid which i call  

526
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:45,839
the standard polar radius and world grid system 72 
is only 313 feet over the entire size of the earth

527
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:54,080
so we have essentially the pyramid being a scale 
model of the earth the northern hemisphere at a  

528
01:06:54,080 --> 01:07:04,160
scale of 43 200 to 1. if we take the pyramid 
enlarge it by 43 200 its height including  

529
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:11,200
the sockle now becomes the polar radius of the 
earth within 300 feet of our satellite surveys  

530
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:19,040
then the two measures of the base are exactly the 
difference between the east-west difference and  

531
01:07:19,040 --> 01:07:27,840
the north-south difference at a square minute at 
the equator now the skeptic and the reductionist  

532
01:07:27,840 --> 01:07:32,000
would dismiss this and say ah it's just a 
coincidence you're just playing with numbers  

533
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:43,040
and i would say okay you know you can believe 
what you want but it's there the numbers are   there you can take the surveys of egypt by coal 
you can take the geodetic surveys i didn't make  

534
01:07:43,040 --> 01:07:50,400
those numbers up or i didn't fudge them and what 
you discover is that when you expand it by 43  

535
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:57,520
200 which you know if if the number was just some 
arbitrary number but it turns out that the the  

536
01:07:57,520 --> 01:08:04,880
uh factor of expansion turns out to be one of the 
critical sacred numbers within the ancient systems  

537
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:12,720
and so here we have the pyramid now enlarged 
by 43 200 times and another way to think of it  

538
01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:19,759
is if we go back to this diagram right 
here you'll see that as the earth turns  

539
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:29,120
every half second it's going to turn this far 
so it means that every two seconds the earth if  

540
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:38,319
you're standing on the equator in two seconds the 
earth has turned 143 200 part of its total orbit  

541
01:08:38,320 --> 01:08:48,320
so if you're standing on the equator in 
two seconds precisely the earth has turned   into a distance exactly equal to the distance 
around the great the base of the great pyramid  

542
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:53,680
now you can dismiss that as being 
coincidence but the numbers don't lie

543
01:08:56,240 --> 01:09:02,080
they're there and so when william r fix was saying 
that someone somewhere thousands of years ago was  

544
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:07,279
able to measure the earth with great precision 
and i haven't of course elaborated upon all the  

545
01:09:07,280 --> 01:09:12,319
details of this i just i'm trying to give you 
the overall picture of how it might have worked

546
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:23,200
referring back to our geodetic data if we look 
at the various ellipsoids that give the polar  

547
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:29,600
radius and then we take each of those polar radii 
going from all of these ellipsoids down the clark  

548
01:09:30,160 --> 01:09:35,280
ellipsoid has been the one of 1880 has been 
the one used in in the united states for all  

549
01:09:36,160 --> 01:09:42,799
non-military and non-nasa related measurements 
we still use on the day-to-day basis if you  

550
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:49,599
if you take a topographic map you know and you're 
going out like a 7.5 quadrangle and you're going  

551
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:55,120
out navigating with a topographic map put out 
by the u.s geological survey they're using the  

552
01:09:55,120 --> 01:10:01,840
clark ellipsoid right there but you'll notice that 
when we take these various polar radii lengths in  

553
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:09,440
uh feet and divide them by 43 200. you can see the 
numbers we get right here remember the height of  

554
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:16,800
the pyramid is estimated at 482.7575 so looking 
at this what you'd see on here which one would  

555
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:23,360
be the closest well you notice it's come out 
very very close to the to the satellite surveys  

556
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:33,680
given that it's very pop and see when 
you have you've got to ask yourself well   why is there a difference between this the 
satellite survey of 72 and the satellite survey of  

557
01:10:33,680 --> 01:10:38,800
80. well if we did another one again with as high 
a degree of accuracy we would discover there's  

558
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:44,159
still going to be a discrepancy and the reason is 
is that the earth spinning through space there are  

559
01:10:44,160 --> 01:10:49,760
various tidal forces working on the earth which 
are constantly causing it to distort its shape by  

560
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:55,199
up to two or three or four or five hundred feet 
so we never would be able to get more accurate  

561
01:10:55,760 --> 01:11:01,440
than three or four hundred feet because the earth 
itself is changing shape and if we were to measure  

562
01:11:01,440 --> 01:11:06,320
it every year for the next 10 years we would get 
10 different numbers they'd all be very close  

563
01:11:07,040 --> 01:11:17,040
but they would deviate somewhat because the earth 
itself there are tidal bulges you know where's the   moon relative to the earth that's going to affect 
if the moon and the sun are on the same side of  

564
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:22,240
the earth that will affect the shape of the earth 
up to being several hundred feet measured over the  

565
01:11:22,240 --> 01:11:29,680
diameter diameter of the earth and so it is not a 
miss to say that the pyramid enshrines a measure  

566
01:11:29,680 --> 01:11:36,080
of the earth that could be considered as accurate 
as those determined by modern satellite surveys  

567
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:42,400
that to me is a very profound insight 
because it does suggest that somebody  

568
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:49,600
once upon a time was able to measure the earth 
size and shape with that level of precision and if  

569
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:54,560
they were able to do that what's the implication 
of that see that's that's the interesting part  

570
01:11:55,440 --> 01:12:02,400
because no primitive culture using the method 
of eratosthenes in about 300 bc in greece  

571
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:13,840
he measured the earth and was generally 
considered to be quite accurate because   he was able to get the circumference of 
the earth within about 500 miles of its  

572
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:18,560
actual measured circumference by using the 
methods available to the ancient greeks  

573
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:25,120
you see and he was considered to be the first 
to measure by by basically putting a stick in  

574
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:30,800
the ground and measuring the angle of the shadow 
uh on the longest day of the year over a couple  

575
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:36,239
of successive years that's actually an exercise 
we do in the sacred geometry class because it's  

576
01:12:36,240 --> 01:12:42,080
very interesting how he did that but he was 
considered to be you know pretty proficient  

577
01:12:42,080 --> 01:12:53,680
because he was able to determine that the 
uh size of the earth was the circumference   of the earth was you know 25 000 miles when 
it's generally considered to be about 24 800  

578
01:12:53,680 --> 01:12:58,320
depending on where you measure so he was you know 
maybe with maybe within 50 miles of the actual  

579
01:12:58,960 --> 01:13:06,000
dimension of the earth but nowhere near as close 
as the pyramid would have been so again if the  

580
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:11,680
even if the pyramid was built four thousand two 
hundred years ago you know you gotta say who four  

581
01:13:11,680 --> 01:13:16,880
thousand two hundred years ago had the technology 
to measure the earth with that degree of accuracy  

582
01:13:17,680 --> 01:13:24,080
now that we know of nobody 4 200 years ago did 
or how they would have done it we don't know  

583
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:30,000
but on the other hand if it turns out that 
the pyramid could be much older it leads us  

584
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:37,040
back to the you know going back 10 000 or 20 
000 years this to me is one of those little um  

585
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:48,800
oh sort of like the the little crack in the 
dike that if you don't keep it plugged the whole   edifice of contemporary knowledge could get 
swept away because we can't acknowledge that  

586
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:53,280
somebody 10 000 or 20 000 years ago was 
scientifically sophisticated that was the  

587
01:13:53,920 --> 01:14:04,000
days of cro-magnon man and alley-oop 
living in the cave and so forth   cavemen which is a silly idea actually yes 
i'm sure people did take refuge in caves  

588
01:14:04,720 --> 01:14:11,120
when uh things got really crazy out here 
yes i think people did take refuge in caves  

589
01:14:11,120 --> 01:14:20,000
but see this is one of those things again that 
if you accept that it's not just a coincidence   it opens up a whole can of worms that mainstream 
science generally doesn't want to address  

590
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:27,599
because we're the epitome of scientific evolution 
right here and now right nobody before we built  

591
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:33,440
satellites could have measured the earth to within 
a couple of hundred feet of its actual dimensions

592
01:14:35,920 --> 01:14:41,840
so given two seconds of time one forty three 
thousand two hundredth part of the daily rotation  

593
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:49,040
a point on the equator will travel a distance 
precisely equal to the perimeter of the great  

594
01:14:49,040 --> 01:14:56,640
pyramids base as measured with the sockle in one 
half second of time a point on the equator will  

595
01:14:56,640 --> 01:15:04,400
rotate a distance equal to one side of the base of 
the great pyramid pyramid measured with the cycle

596
01:15:06,640 --> 01:15:15,199
so here you have a time and 
space measure integrated into one   the time measure comes in because it's 
the span of time that the earth has moved  

597
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:24,880
in two seconds the earth has turned and moved   a distance within a fraction of an inch being 
the distance around the base of the great pyramid

598
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:32,320
and so the height of the great pure measured 
pyramid measured with the socket was 143  

599
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:38,800
200 part of the earth's polar radius so therefore 
the great pyramid is a model of one hemisphere  

600
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:49,840
of the earth at a scale of one to forty three 
thousand two hundred so if we took the great   pyramid and we created the duplicate and turned it 
upside down and put the two together base to base  

601
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:57,840
that would now give us the polar diameter one more 
example the parthenon to show that this geodetic  

602
01:15:57,840 --> 01:16:05,840
knowledge was still extant down to the time of 
the building of the parthenon about 2400 years ago  

603
01:16:06,720 --> 01:16:19,840
this is the east facade we've all familiar with 
the parthenon it's almost as well known as the   great pyramid well if we measure its base in the 
manner that i'm showing here it's 100 greek feet  

604
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:25,920
so how long was a greek foot a little bit 
longer than our modern foot of 12 inches  

605
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:34,960
before we do that let's look at the dimensions 
of the parthenon based upon our american feet  

606
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:46,080
that we use the east facade is 101.2957 dot 
dot dot feet so if we divide that by a hundred  

607
01:16:46,080 --> 01:16:52,080
we get the length of the greek foot which 
would have been 1.0129 etc of our american  

608
01:16:52,800 --> 01:17:01,840
which are actually the in british feat okay i 
better write that down so we don't forget it

609
01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:15,840
that's good enough right there there's the width 
of the parthenon measured in our american feet and  

610
01:17:16,720 --> 01:17:25,680
uh also notice the latitude of athens where 
the period where the parthenon is located is 37  

611
01:17:25,680 --> 01:17:38,720
degrees 58 minutes north and i'm going to write 
that down 37 degrees 58 minutes so it's almost  

612
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:49,199
almost 38 degrees north and here we have 
based upon numerical and proportional  

613
01:17:49,200 --> 01:17:54,080
relationships augmented by extensive analysis 
of ancient structures artifacts and texts  

614
01:17:54,960 --> 01:18:01,600
sticcini who was considered one of the preeminent 
meteorologists of the 20th century he determined  

615
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:08,240
various lengths of the foot he came 
up with the greek foot of 1.0114064  

616
01:18:09,040 --> 01:18:13,680
now notice here we've got the width of the east 
facade of the parthenon divided by a hundred  

617
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:24,719
gives a greek foot of 1.1 1.0129 for a difference 
of point zero eighteen inch in excess of the  

618
01:18:24,720 --> 01:18:31,120
length of the greek foot is calculated by stichini 
it is acknowledged by architectural historians  

619
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:36,400
that the parthenon was originally built to be 100 
greek feet in width this would have made it equal  

620
01:18:36,400 --> 01:18:44,719
to 101.14 english feet when built now if we go 
back to the length of one degree of the meridian  

621
01:18:45,680 --> 01:18:50,960
and we look right here at the latitude of 
athens we find something very interesting  

622
01:18:52,320 --> 01:19:00,079
length of one degree of the meridian at the 
latitude of athens is 68.962 miles or 364

623
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:10,719
121.647 feet   so if we take that number and divide it by 60 
gives us the length of one minute of meridian arc  

624
01:19:11,680 --> 01:19:17,760
then we divide that meridian arc by 60 it gives 
us one second of meridian arc and notice what  

625
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:26,400
one second of meridian arc is 101.1449 feet so 
one second of meridian arc at 38 degrees north  

626
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:32,480
latitude given the international ellipsoid and the 
clark ellipsoid you'll know here that it's exact  

627
01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:41,679
so in other words what we have there the total 
difference in length of one second of meridian arc  

628
01:19:41,680 --> 01:19:48,640
at 38 degrees north latitude and the 
east facade of the parthenon is .05 inch  

629
01:19:49,760 --> 01:19:57,679
but again that's for 38 north latitude and it's 
actually at 37.58 so if we make that adjustment  

630
01:19:57,680 --> 01:20:05,760
of two minutes of arc south this point zero five 
pretty much just disappears into nothing so what  

631
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:13,519
we have is the parthenon again maybe coincidence 
but here we have the parthenon being precisely one  

632
01:20:13,520 --> 01:20:23,280
second of arc of the earth's circumference at that 
latitude that it's placed now again that implies  

633
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:29,440
somebody was able to measure the earth with 
incredible precision if this isn't a coincidence  

634
01:20:30,560 --> 01:20:40,000
and i think the burden of proof would be on 
the person who tries to dismiss this as being   coincidental because the two examples i've shown 
you here could be multiplied many times over  

635
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:46,960
we haven't even talked about the gothic cathedrals 
the fact that every gothic cathedral was built  

636
01:20:46,960 --> 01:20:54,640
with its own cubit and that cubit is based upon a 
multiple or a subdivision of the meridian length  

637
01:20:54,640 --> 01:21:00,480
at the latitude that the cathedral was built so 
you could take many examples of this and what  

638
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:06,320
i'm suggesting here is not necessarily that the 
gothic cathedral builders of 800 years ago were  

639
01:21:06,320 --> 01:21:13,119
able to measure the earth with that accuracy but 
then again it does seem to imply that somebody was  

640
01:21:13,120 --> 01:21:24,000
that somebody was able to measure the earth that 
maybe there has been a tradition going back to   who knows when from the building of the pyramids 
coming down through the age of the greeks right  

641
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:29,760
down to the building of the gothic european 
gothic cathedrals 800 years ago a tradition  

642
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:37,039
of very sophisticated geodetic knowledge well 
again this this opens up a huge can of worms about  

643
01:21:37,040 --> 01:21:41,840
when people were supposed to what they knew 
and when they were supposed to have learned it  

644
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:51,679
so there's another dimension to this 
as well and this is i'm only going to   show you a few examples out of hundreds of 
possible examples i could be showing you

645
01:21:54,160 --> 01:21:59,200
ancient writings semitic writings for these 
and i'm coming with two examples here the  

646
01:21:59,200 --> 01:22:06,640
hebrew ancient writings which would be kabbalistic 
writings uh the the hebrew old testament the torah  

647
01:22:07,360 --> 01:22:18,159
the midrash all of those and then the greek 
alphabet the new testament was written in greek   all of the pythagorean neo-pythagorean literature 
written into greek was it turns out both of those  

648
01:22:18,160 --> 01:22:23,280
languages this was prior to the advent of 
the hindu arabic numeral system the hindu  

649
01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:28,480
arabic numeral system is when we came up with 
what we now have is we have our alphabet and  

650
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:33,840
we have our set of numbers and there are two 
different things right we use our alphabet for  

651
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:44,320
the spoken language in written language and 
we use numbers for calculating in mathematics   but they're different you know we don't but prior 
to the advent of the hindu arabic numeral system  

652
01:22:44,320 --> 01:22:50,880
in the semitic languages the same symbols that 
were letters were also numbers and the key  

653
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:56,560
was what you see right here called the denery 
system so aleph was one bet was two gimmel  

654
01:22:56,560 --> 01:23:03,600
was three dalet was four hey was five wow was 
six zion seven and so on down to ray sheen and  

655
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:10,080
tao 200 300 and 400 yid which was considered the 
seed of the hebrew alphabet had the value of tan  

656
01:23:11,120 --> 01:23:17,680
okay so units tens and hundreds then there 
was a symbolic component to each of the for  

657
01:23:17,680 --> 01:23:26,080
example aleph originally was the word for an ox 
and uh bait was originally the word for house  

658
01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:32,480
gimmo originally the word for camel and so on then 
we get to the greek system and it's also daenerys  

659
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:39,920
system units tens and hundreds so alpha beta 
gamma delta epsilon di gamma zeta eta theta etc  

660
01:23:39,920 --> 01:23:49,840
one through nine then yota kappa lambda mu news 
i omicron pi copper 10 through 90 and so on row  

661
01:23:49,840 --> 01:23:56,639
through sampi wasn't actually a written letter it 
was just simply included to get the value of 900.  

662
01:23:57,520 --> 01:24:02,480
okay so we have the same system units 
tens and hundreds so how is this employed  

663
01:24:03,040 --> 01:24:09,120
well here's an example here's a lethal 
which was the greek word for truth and if  

664
01:24:09,120 --> 01:24:15,760
you add up the eta the alpha the lambda 
the eta theta epsilon iota and alpha  

665
01:24:15,760 --> 01:24:21,840
based on the values that i just showed you the 
total value is 72 and that's one of our key  

666
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:30,239
sacred numbers because most of the numbers that 
i showed you here are multiples of 72 36 or 72.  

667
01:24:32,160 --> 01:24:38,800
catabola which means conception the first 
moment of creation kappa alpha tau alpha  

668
01:24:38,800 --> 01:24:45,199
beta omicron lambda ada take the values again 
directly from the historically authenticated  

669
01:24:45,200 --> 01:24:52,160
table that i showed you and they add up to 432 
so there you see these numbers showing up here

670
01:24:54,720 --> 01:25:02,240
yerushalayim or jerusalem iota epsilon rho 
omicron upsilon this would be the greek spelling  

671
01:25:02,240 --> 01:25:09,920
in the new testament sigma alpha lambda eta and mu 
there's the values of the individual letters iota  

672
01:25:09,920 --> 01:25:17,120
which was tan epsilon 5 etc and 
when you add those up you get 864.  

673
01:25:18,160 --> 01:25:24,160
again do we find that number on our list yes we do 
these numbers again are showing up with redundancy  

674
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:34,160
the temple of immortality honeos uh let's 
see i forgot how to pronounce that uh

675
01:25:36,320 --> 01:25:38,400
athanasius or naos

676
01:25:46,640 --> 01:25:53,600
athanasius that's it the temple of immortality 
so if we take that spelling add it up it also  

677
01:25:53,600 --> 01:26:04,080
is 864 and i'll work on my pronunciations for next 
time ah the holy ghost tawaghian numa numa like  

678
01:26:04,640 --> 01:26:12,880
root of our words like 
pneumatic means the holy ghost   or the holy spirit add up those the 
value of those and you get 1080.

679
01:26:14,960 --> 01:26:25,200
the fountain of wisdom pegasuphias also adds 
to 1080. so these are just a few examples of  

680
01:26:26,720 --> 01:26:37,200
then i heard another great voice from heaven 
saying come out my people out of her lest you   take part in her sins lest you share in her 
plagues a phrase from the book of revelations  

681
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:44,240
and 1296 which is half of the great year 
cycle so i mean these again these these  

682
01:26:44,240 --> 01:26:50,080
examples can be multiplied by hundreds literally 
by hundreds and this is actually a one of the sub  

683
01:26:50,640 --> 01:26:56,400
subdivisions of the study of kabbalah which 
is the the gamatria the study of the numerical  

684
01:26:56,400 --> 01:27:02,080
or mathematical basis of language and what you 
discover when you go into the mathematical basis  

685
01:27:02,080 --> 01:27:07,280
of languages the whole thing is constructed 
upon the same architecture of sacred numbers  

686
01:27:07,280 --> 01:27:16,080
that we've been looking at here for the last hour probably of all familiar with things like here 
is wisdom let him that hath understanding count  

687
01:27:16,080 --> 01:27:28,720
the number of the beast where is the number of a 
man 603 score and six you ever heard that probably   the most famous and controversial number out of 
the bible 666 well if you want to understand what  

688
01:27:28,720 --> 01:27:35,840
that is actually referring to you have to peel 
back the outer literal representation of these  

689
01:27:35,840 --> 01:27:46,960
tails and look at the underlying mathematical 
architecture because that's where it's concealed   and it actually turns out that the orbit orbital 
velocity of the earth around the sun is 66 600  

690
01:27:46,960 --> 01:27:52,800
miles per hour exactly and that's one of the first 
astronomical connections and then there's many  

691
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:58,480
many more connections with that number that we 
find occurring in sacred geometry so all of this  

692
01:27:58,480 --> 01:28:04,239
there's a lot of silliness and accretion stuff 
that's accreted to that the belief in that number  

693
01:28:04,240 --> 01:28:09,440
by basically fundamentalists and superstitious 
people who don't look at the underlying science

694
01:28:11,920 --> 01:28:21,120
but we will take a couple of minutes 
here and look at a few things   i lifted up this is from the old testament 
zechariah i lifted up mine eyes again and looked  

695
01:28:21,680 --> 01:28:28,240
and behold a man with a measuring line in his hand 
then said i withered goes thou and he said unto me  

696
01:28:28,240 --> 01:28:32,960
to measure jerusalem to see what is the 
breath thereof and what is the length thereof  

697
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:40,560
old testament prophet zechariah so here was the 
beginning of his of his prophetic experience his  

698
01:28:40,560 --> 01:28:46,480
prophetic vision as he sees this man who's got 
a measuring line in his hand and he says he's  

699
01:28:46,480 --> 01:28:52,080
going to go measure the holy city and when he 
does see then what's the revelation it follows  

700
01:28:52,080 --> 01:28:57,920
the revelation is the sacred geometry that 
that composes the the that is the basis of  

701
01:28:57,920 --> 01:29:03,440
the architecture of the holy city so the whole 
revelation is really it's a geometric revelation  

702
01:29:04,880 --> 01:29:09,920
uh again from the book of revelations and 
i looked and lo a lamb stood on the mount  

703
01:29:09,920 --> 01:29:15,920
of zion which to anybody whose verse knows that 
that's a reference to the sign of ares the lamb  

704
01:29:16,640 --> 01:29:23,680
and with him a hundred and forty and four 
thousand which is this number right here having  

705
01:29:23,680 --> 01:29:31,679
his father's name written in their 
foreheads what does that mean well   it means that somebody who studies sacred 
geometry eventually you've got these numbers  

706
01:29:31,680 --> 01:29:37,680
as such an integral part of your consciousness 
in your forehead in your in your frontal lobe  

707
01:29:37,680 --> 01:29:43,440
your your waking consciousness that these numbers 
literally become a part of the way you experience  

708
01:29:43,440 --> 01:29:48,960
reality and experience the world because the 
numbers are all around us in the world it gives  

709
01:29:48,960 --> 01:29:54,080
a shape to the world it defines the periods 
of time that governs the cycles of our life  

710
01:29:55,280 --> 01:30:00,320
and i heard a voice from heaven as the voice of 
many waters and as the voice of a great thunder  

711
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:06,960
and i heard the voice of harpers harping with 
their harps and they sung as it were a new song  

712
01:30:07,920 --> 01:30:13,760
before the throne and before the four beasts 
what are the four beasts the bull the lion the  

713
01:30:13,760 --> 01:30:19,280
eagle and the man divides the cosmic wheel into 
periods of six thousand four hundred and eighty  

714
01:30:19,280 --> 01:30:25,440
years which i sure certainly should add because 
that's an important number so there's a veiled  

715
01:30:25,440 --> 01:30:30,800
reference to that cycle of time six thousand 
four hundred and eighty and no man could learn  

716
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:36,639
that song but the hundred and forty and four 
thousand which were redeemed from the earth now  

717
01:30:37,280 --> 01:30:44,719
when you get into kabbalistic studies you can you 
can go to the english translations to kind of be  

718
01:30:44,720 --> 01:30:53,760
to lead you into the outer portals but if 
you want to get into the inner teaching   you've got to go beyond that you've got 
to go back to the original languages and  

719
01:30:53,760 --> 01:31:05,520
i'm not going to get too much into that but the 
word redeemed is actually a very interesting word   it's talking about the redeemed of the earth 144 
thousand we discovered that the word was agarazzo  

720
01:31:06,160 --> 01:31:11,360
from agora and it means to go to market so 
basically what it's saying is that those who  

721
01:31:12,560 --> 01:31:17,280
achieve salvation at the at the day of 
judgment are those who go out and go shopping  

722
01:31:19,120 --> 01:31:26,560
what well didn't that and that what george bush 
told us to do after the yeah see so george bush  

723
01:31:28,400 --> 01:31:30,560
he had his thumb on the pulse of

724
01:31:33,520 --> 01:31:40,000
but actually see why does it what's the 
connection with going to market well as a place  

725
01:31:40,960 --> 01:31:47,280
probably the town square that should be the first 
clue the square see there's your geometry uh  

726
01:31:47,280 --> 01:31:52,800
as a place of public resort by implication a 
market of thoroughfare so the idea first is the  

727
01:31:52,800 --> 01:31:58,000
idea of a square because the marketplace 
would be built around a square a literal  

728
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:04,960
square so it it became associated with the idea 
of people gathering within this square see uh  

729
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:14,639
it's uh comes from well agarazzo comes from 
uh yeah see here so to uh go to market by  

730
01:32:14,640 --> 01:32:21,280
implication to purchase especially to redeem 
to redeem and it comes from this route agora  

731
01:32:22,640 --> 01:32:28,880
which is related to this aguero the idea of 
collecting one's faculties this is the idea of  

732
01:32:28,880 --> 01:32:35,760
collecting within the square again right well this 
thinking now about metaphorically collecting one's  

733
01:32:35,760 --> 01:32:43,760
faculties but also to awaken or to rouse literally 
from sleep from sitting or lying from disease or  

734
01:32:43,760 --> 01:32:52,400
death or figuratively from obscurity or rune it 
means to awake to lift up to raise up to rear up  

735
01:32:52,400 --> 01:32:57,600
so see all of these ideas are what you're led to 
once you start going into the original kabbalistic  

736
01:32:57,600 --> 01:33:04,400
meanings of the language so what starts out like 
go shopping go to the market means going to the  

737
01:33:04,400 --> 01:33:09,760
town square it means the gathering within this 
square so here's the link with your geometry  

738
01:33:09,760 --> 01:33:15,360
but then one of the words that we we look at when 
we study the the kabbalistic study of words is we  

739
01:33:15,360 --> 01:33:20,880
look at the original roots but then we act we look 
at how did they bifurcate and how did they lead  

740
01:33:20,880 --> 01:33:26,960
because you can follow the evolutionary paths of 
language to get back to what some of the original  

741
01:33:26,960 --> 01:33:32,560
meanings actually were to try to get to what 
the authors of these sacred writings were really  

742
01:33:32,560 --> 01:33:42,800
trying to get to because you've got to remember 
that all of these sacred writings have gone   through multiple layers of translation by people 
who may or may not have understood the original  

743
01:33:43,600 --> 01:33:51,040
doctrines that were concealed in there 
symbolically and mathematically also from the book  

744
01:33:51,040 --> 01:33:57,600
of rev oh the reference to the new song is very 
interesting because uh and and i would defer later  

745
01:33:57,600 --> 01:34:04,000
to jeremy on this who's been studying the sacred 
geometry of music but there is a phrygian mode of  

746
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:12,240
of representing the octave that goes from 432 
cycles per second to 864 cycles per second so this  

747
01:34:12,240 --> 01:34:17,760
the the reference to singing a new song suggests 
to me that possibly we're talking about a change  

748
01:34:17,760 --> 01:34:25,119
in frequency involving life here on earth and that 
those who change their consciousness accordingly  

749
01:34:25,120 --> 01:34:30,160
will be in harmony with the changing frequencies 
and i believe that that is one of the core  

750
01:34:30,160 --> 01:34:36,160
teachings of this is that as earth goes through 
its evolutionary journey through the galaxy  

751
01:34:36,160 --> 01:34:42,800
through varying geometric relationships with the 
astronomical universe what is happening is that  

752
01:34:42,800 --> 01:34:47,920
the frequencies impinging upon the earth are 
constantly going through an evolution as well  

753
01:34:48,720 --> 01:34:55,200
and part of understanding the ancient secrets 
or methods of the master builders of old  

754
01:34:55,200 --> 01:35:01,120
was utilizing the sacred geometry and the 
geodetic knowledge to create structures  

755
01:35:01,120 --> 01:35:10,640
that resonated with the earth because they were 
harmonically attuned to the earth i think that's   part of what's going on trying to understand 
the sacred science behind structures like the  

756
01:35:10,640 --> 01:35:16,880
parthenon and the great pyramid and many of the 
other temples is this science of harmony of the  

757
01:35:16,880 --> 01:35:23,199
science of resonance and creating structures 
that vibrated according to certain frequencies  

758
01:35:23,200 --> 01:35:29,360
and those frequencies would be attuned to the 
slowly changing frequencies of the earth itself  

759
01:35:30,240 --> 01:35:41,280
as it goes on its cosmic journey 
through through the universe   um i saw a new heaven and a new earth for the 
first heaven and the first earth were passed away  

760
01:35:41,280 --> 01:35:49,760
and i john saw the holy city the new jerusalem 
jerusalem is the 864 right 864. that's the  

761
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:56,320
jerusalem coming down from god out of heaven 
prepared as a bride adorned for her husband  

762
01:35:56,320 --> 01:36:02,079
and there came unto me one of the seven angels 
saying come hither i will show thee the bride  

763
01:36:02,080 --> 01:36:11,760
the lamb's wife and he carried me away in 
the spirit to a great and high mountain   and showed me that great city the holy 
jerusalem descending out of heaven from god

764
01:36:14,080 --> 01:36:21,040
having the glory of god and her light was like 
unto a stone most precious it had a wall great and  

765
01:36:21,040 --> 01:36:27,520
high and had 12 gates and at the gates 12 angels 
and names written thereon now of course those  

766
01:36:27,520 --> 01:36:34,160
names are mathematical keys on the east three 
gates on the north three gates on the south three  

767
01:36:34,160 --> 01:36:40,720
gates and on the west three gates and the wall of 
the city had 12 foundations and in them the names  

768
01:36:40,720 --> 01:36:47,120
of the 12 apostles of the lamb and he that talked 
with me had a golden reed to measure the city so  

769
01:36:47,120 --> 01:36:53,280
here again we have this idea of the measuring of 
the city because the city is the repository of the  

770
01:36:53,280 --> 01:37:00,559
cosmic doctrine the gates thereof in the wall 
thereof and the city lieth four square and the  

771
01:37:00,560 --> 01:37:07,120
length is as large as the breadth and he measured 
the city with the reed twelve thousand furlongs  

772
01:37:07,680 --> 01:37:12,800
the length and the height of it are equal and 
he measured the wall thereof a hundred and forty  

773
01:37:12,800 --> 01:37:19,760
and four cubits according to the measure of a 
man that is of the angel and i find that verse  

774
01:37:19,760 --> 01:37:26,800
to be particularly potent in its meaning because 
first of all we have to ask the question what are  

775
01:37:26,800 --> 01:37:32,400
we talking about when what is the bible talking 
about when it refers to angels well you know the  

776
01:37:32,400 --> 01:37:37,679
counterpart to angels are found in all cultures 
it's just in the bible they're called angels  

777
01:37:38,320 --> 01:37:45,360
uh who are the messengers right from this other 
domain but in other cultures they were usually  

778
01:37:45,360 --> 01:37:50,880
referred to as the gods and basically in the 
christianization of the ancient pagan traditions  

779
01:37:51,840 --> 01:37:57,280
the gods were replaced by the angels but their 
function within the cosmic hierarchy is identical  

780
01:37:58,320 --> 01:38:02,880
and so uh the fact that the 
measure of a man a human

781
01:38:05,440 --> 01:38:15,840
is the same as the measure of 
the angel is very interesting   because it's saying that we're somehow linked 
to the gods through a common system of measure  

782
01:38:17,200 --> 01:38:23,600
but notice the numbers 144 cubits of course you 
got to ask what is a cubit and that leads us into  

783
01:38:23,600 --> 01:38:30,640
some interesting digressions there also the 12 000 
furlongs well anybody know how much a furlong is  

784
01:38:31,680 --> 01:38:42,000
what is a furlong there's furlong 
furlongs have almost fallen into disuse   it's a british or english unit of measurement 
but it found its way into the king james bible  

785
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:47,760
it was basically the british counterpart of 
the greek stade which had various lengths but  

786
01:38:47,760 --> 01:38:54,800
basically the same length as the furlong what 
was the furlock furlong where is a furlong used  

787
01:38:54,800 --> 01:39:06,960
today yeah who goes to the track horse racing 
a furlong is 660 feet 1 8 part of a mile well  

788
01:39:08,160 --> 01:39:13,280
here's what's interesting about the furlong if 
you multiply it by 12 to convert it to inches  

789
01:39:13,840 --> 01:39:22,080
you discover that the furlong is exactly 
7920 inches where did we see that number  

790
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:30,400
this is now a test of of your memory the 
diameter of the earth remember i said the  

791
01:39:30,400 --> 01:39:35,840
diameter of the earth taken through the tropics 
the sacred number that's representing the earth  

792
01:39:37,200 --> 01:39:44,640
the furlong is to the inch as the earth is to a 
mile it's a proportion this is a sacred proportion  

793
01:39:44,640 --> 01:39:50,800
that was intentionally embodied into the units 
of measurement so that we lay out a fur along  

794
01:39:51,520 --> 01:39:56,960
right 660 feet one inch which is derived 
from our thumb the width of our thumb  

795
01:39:56,960 --> 01:40:09,280
right there you can check it out put your thumb 
on there and you'll discover it's an inch wide   that's the digit so the thumb is to your foot 
in this cosmic relationship of twelve to one  

796
01:40:10,080 --> 01:40:17,680
and when you pace like this is how pace was 
generally considered you start from one point  

797
01:40:17,680 --> 01:40:23,280
put your heel against the point and 
then every other step you count one two  

798
01:40:24,720 --> 01:40:35,120
three a thousand of those averaging 5.28 feet 
gave us the mile right a thousand times 5.28  

799
01:40:35,120 --> 01:40:46,080
is five thousand two hundred eighty and 
that was the origin of the buy the mile   is literally a mill a thousand human paces the 
pace think about the pace what that is our foot  

800
01:40:46,720 --> 01:40:54,480
our pace our pace our foot is what anchors us 
to the earth our pace is what moves us about the  

801
01:40:54,480 --> 01:40:59,600
face of the earth right the most fundamental 
relationship we have with the earth our feet  

802
01:41:00,400 --> 01:41:14,159
right that ratio of pace to foot 5.28 now we have 
the furlong is 12 000 of these things right 12 000  

803
01:41:15,360 --> 01:41:24,000
12 000 the holy city is 12 000 of these things 660 
feet multiply that out you discover 7 million 920  

804
01:41:24,560 --> 01:41:31,840
000 feet so how big is that we'll divide 
that by the number of feet in a mile  

805
01:41:32,720 --> 01:41:43,760
5280 and what you discover is it's precisely 1500 
miles so what what would be 1500 miles in diameter  

806
01:41:45,280 --> 01:41:50,800
is there some some object out there 
that could be 1500 miles in diameter  

807
01:41:52,480 --> 01:42:01,119
it's certainly described as being something 
they see in the heavens right well i'll leave   this one an open-ended question for right 
now but here's something that's interesting  

808
01:42:02,080 --> 01:42:06,880
if we take this number and divide 
it into compare it to the earth

809
01:42:08,960 --> 01:42:18,400
to get a sense of scale earth 7920 holy 
city 1500 so we put 79 20 over 1500  

810
01:42:19,280 --> 01:42:26,239
and if you quickly do that calculation in your 
head you'll discover that 1500 goes into 79  

811
01:42:26,800 --> 01:42:38,400
20 exactly 5.28 times the relationship of our foot 
to our pace so here's a very strange correlation  

812
01:42:38,400 --> 01:42:46,080
the earth to the holy city is the same as the pace 
to the foot what are they trying to say there well  

813
01:42:46,080 --> 01:42:54,080
one of the implications of this it follows 
from this truth the truth is that we humans  

814
01:42:54,080 --> 01:43:00,960
are ultimately designed according to the cosmic 
measure we were created in the image of god  

815
01:43:00,960 --> 01:43:08,320
right and god is the ultimate cosmic measure and 
we being created in the image of god embody the  

816
01:43:08,320 --> 01:43:14,800
cosmic measures so when protagoras said man is the 
measure of all things what he was implying is that  

817
01:43:14,800 --> 01:43:22,400
we are the ultimate yardstick for the cosmos in 
fact when one looks at the scale of phenomena  

818
01:43:22,400 --> 01:43:33,760
from the human up to the largest macro scale 
that we know of and from the human down to   the smallest micro scale we know of where are we 
within that hierarchy right smack in the middle  

819
01:43:34,560 --> 01:43:40,000
so there's as much above us as there is below us 
there's as much greater than us as there is lesser  

820
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:46,240
than us and i think that's one of the implications 
of this is that when we begin looking at our  

821
01:43:46,240 --> 01:43:51,760
sacred geometry we realize it's the ultimate 
fusion of all of these phenomena on all scales  

822
01:43:51,760 --> 01:43:58,239
and the ultimate component or the ultimate uh the 
ultimate symbol of all that fusion is we ourselves  

823
01:43:59,200 --> 01:44:06,240
and then of course ultimately 
it's our consciousness because   like i said with the with with his name 
written in our forehead what that means  

824
01:44:06,240 --> 01:44:14,720
is is that we when you study sacred geometry 
you're literally building an edifice in your  

825
01:44:14,720 --> 01:44:22,080
consciousness you're building a form out of your 
own the the material of your own conscious mind  

826
01:44:22,080 --> 01:44:27,600
that reflects this order of nature 
of cosmic nature that's all about us  

827
01:44:29,200 --> 01:44:35,040
and that's the power and why study of sacred 
geometry can now ultimately be a key to accessing  

828
01:44:35,040 --> 01:44:48,160
lots of other things like the kabbalah and then 
the alchemy and the hermetic wisdom and the   gnostic traditions and the traditions of the vedas 
and so forth there it is 12 000 furlongs the city  

829
01:44:48,160 --> 01:44:57,280
lieth four square forty eight thousand furlongs 
at a perimeter it's also described as cubicle

830
01:44:59,600 --> 01:45:05,520
twelve thousand furlongs equals seven million nine   hundred and twenty thousand feet 
which equals fifteen hundred miles

831
01:45:08,240 --> 01:45:19,040
the total perimeter thirty one thousand six 
hundred and eighty that has a profound mystical   significance which we will save for another 
time so there it is a tabulation of some of  

832
01:45:19,040 --> 01:45:27,600
the stuff we've covered the diameter of the earth 
at 79.20 one furlong 79 20 inches the diameter of  

833
01:45:27,600 --> 01:45:34,880
the new jerusalem and twenty thousand feet which 
is fifteen hundred miles one mile is five thousand  

834
01:45:34,880 --> 01:45:40,960
two hundred and eighty feet or a thousand paces 
of five point two eight feet one and a half miles  

835
01:45:41,520 --> 01:45:47,680
is seven thousand nine hundred twenty feet and 
here's the pace to the foot equals the earth to  

836
01:45:47,680 --> 01:45:55,520
the holy city which equals 79 20 to 1500 there's 
that magic ratio of 5.28 that links the earth  

837
01:45:55,520 --> 01:46:04,480
to this other cosmic entity for now going unnamed 
that relates to our own scale exactly as our pace  

838
01:46:04,480 --> 01:46:10,320
does to our foot and what you discover is that 
if you're taller or shorter it doesn't matter  

839
01:46:10,320 --> 01:46:16,239
because it's a proportional relationship if you're 
tall or your pace i have a my pace is in excess of  

840
01:46:16,240 --> 01:46:22,080
six feet so 5.28 you know you're going to have 
a somewhat shorter but you're going to discover  

841
01:46:22,080 --> 01:46:28,560
that the ratio is relatively constant because as 
you get taller presumably your feet get bigger  

842
01:46:30,400 --> 01:46:35,360
with some exceptions right i know some 
little people with really big feet

843
01:46:39,040 --> 01:46:47,120
and here is the hebrew cubit which is 18 inches 
remember 144 cubits according to the measure of  

844
01:46:47,120 --> 01:46:54,000
a man that is of the angel we have the egyptian 
royal cuban of 1.727 feet the wall of the city was  

845
01:46:54,000 --> 01:47:05,760
144 cubits if we take the 144 cubits that are the 
hebrew cubits it's 216 feet or 2592 inches add one  

846
01:47:05,760 --> 01:47:12,639
zero on the end of that and we have the great ear 
cycle 25 920 years if we express it instead in  

847
01:47:12,640 --> 01:47:19,760
egyptian cubits which may have been the original 
intent if not implic implying that either cubit  

848
01:47:19,760 --> 01:47:31,039
was was legitimate 144 egyptian royal cubits of 
144 times 1.727 is 248.814 move the decimal over  

849
01:47:31,680 --> 01:47:37,760
two points you got twenty four thousand eight 
hundred and eighty one point call that miles  

850
01:47:39,600 --> 01:47:48,720
and there's the circumference of the earth 24 881 
miles so there's all kinds of information embedded  

851
01:47:48,720 --> 01:47:55,280
in here but you've got to have the key to begin to 
unlock it okay and then also notice that the moon  

852
01:47:55,280 --> 01:48:03,840
2160 miles or 17280 furlongs we set the diameter 
of the moon to the diameter of the holy city  

853
01:48:05,120 --> 01:48:13,600
there's our 1.44 ratio so what we have here 
is this redundancy over and over again we have  

854
01:48:14,320 --> 01:48:19,520
these same numbers recurring over and over again 
in the measure of time and space both in absolute  

855
01:48:19,520 --> 01:48:24,400
dimensions but also in the proportional 
relationships that result from comparing  

856
01:48:25,040 --> 01:48:30,640
these various entities of time and space as 
we've learned now the diameter of the moon is  

857
01:48:31,680 --> 01:48:40,000
miles the diameter of the sun is 864 thousand as 
it turns out if you take the diameter of the sun  

858
01:48:40,880 --> 01:48:48,159
and multiply it by this number right here it gives 
us the distance between the earth and the sun  

859
01:48:48,880 --> 01:48:57,120
and if we take the diameter of the moon which 
is 2160 multiply it by the same factor of 108  

860
01:48:57,760 --> 01:49:06,159
we discover that we now have the earth moon 
distance so it's this 108 factor this 108 spacing  

861
01:49:06,160 --> 01:49:13,360
this proportional relationship we could express it 
this way solar distance to solar diameter equals  

862
01:49:13,360 --> 01:49:19,840
lunar distance to lunar diameter and the value 
of that proportion is the sacred number 108.  

863
01:49:20,640 --> 01:49:28,000
as we see embodied right here in bakheng of 
cambodia from the 12th century with its 108 towers  

864
01:49:29,360 --> 01:49:34,480
and there are many examples of how these 
numbers were incorporated into the fabric  

865
01:49:35,040 --> 01:49:42,000
of sacred architecture that there has been some 
kind of a universal system at use in the ancient  

866
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:48,080
world and these various cultural groups whether 
it was the egyptians or sumerians or mayans or  

867
01:49:48,080 --> 01:49:55,440
the hopewellians or the megalithic builders 
had access to some universal system from some  

868
01:49:55,440 --> 01:50:02,960
source that was outside their own cultural 
context and i suggest that the source of that  

869
01:50:02,960 --> 01:50:10,160
goes back into deep time that takes us back beyond 
the threshold of known history into the realm of  

870
01:50:10,160 --> 01:50:17,440
mythical history which means we're going back like 
into the ice age back into the pleistocene to use  

871
01:50:17,440 --> 01:50:24,239
the geologic geologist term back into the to the 
deep recesses of the human tenure on planet earth  

872
01:50:25,120 --> 01:50:31,600
whose only memory has come down to us not in the 
form of recorded history but in the form of myth  

873
01:50:32,160 --> 01:50:38,800
and epic story and legend and so forth because as 
it turns out if we in this way this is again is a  

874
01:50:38,800 --> 01:50:46,320
is a good topic for the sacred geometry class 
when we analyze plato's description of atlantis  

875
01:50:47,200 --> 01:50:53,520
plato basically gave the sink the date 
of the sinking of atlantis as 9 000 years  

876
01:50:54,160 --> 01:51:00,880
prior to solon that the egyptian the the 
the athenian poet and statesman solon  

877
01:51:01,520 --> 01:51:06,160
did a 10-year exile in egypt and it 
was solon that brought back the tale  

878
01:51:06,800 --> 01:51:15,360
of atlantis and presented it to the to the greeks 
and solon basically made that journey around 600  

879
01:51:15,360 --> 01:51:24,080
bc so if you had the 9 000 years to the 600 bc 
we come up with a date of about 11 600 years ago  

880
01:51:24,800 --> 01:51:32,159
for plato's date for this the the demise of 
atlantis well it's very interesting that the date  

881
01:51:32,160 --> 01:51:40,640
11 600 years has been independently discovered 
by geologists looking at the tempo of various  

882
01:51:40,640 --> 01:51:47,840
catastrophes that have occurred on earth and to 
those catastrophes is where i'm now going to turn

883
01:51:50,080 --> 01:51:55,760
catastrophes in the time of man the tempo of 
global change what i've done here is i put  

884
01:51:55,760 --> 01:52:04,239
a time bar that goes from the present right here 
this is us now this is today right here is may 3rd  

885
01:52:05,360 --> 01:52:13,600
at 4 o'clock is it 4 o'clock that's right here and 
this is 150 000 years ago the reason i used 150  

886
01:52:13,600 --> 01:52:20,400
000 years is that some of the earliest skeletal 
remains ever discovered of modern humans date  

887
01:52:20,400 --> 01:52:27,760
back to 150 to even to 180 000 years skeletons 
that appear to be indistinguishable from a modern  

888
01:52:27,760 --> 01:52:34,960
skeleton which suggests that modern humans with 
presumably equivalent intelligence to our own  

889
01:52:35,680 --> 01:52:42,480
were present on the planet at least this far 
back so here we've got a 150 000 year time span  

890
01:52:43,040 --> 01:52:48,560
you'll notice this little red bar at the end that 
red bar represents the span of recorded history  

891
01:52:49,520 --> 01:52:59,040
which is basically the advent of cine sumerian 
uniform writing so if it turns out that there were  

892
01:52:59,040 --> 01:53:08,160
modern humans living through this whole span of 
time why is there no history well now you got to  

893
01:53:08,160 --> 01:53:15,520
do is turn to these various things that i've put 
on here these are events that have occurred and  

894
01:53:15,520 --> 01:53:21,200
i used a certain criteria for these events and 
here's the criteria i used i began studying

895
01:53:23,360 --> 01:53:29,760
the record of geological change climate 
change environmental change and i focused on  

896
01:53:30,800 --> 01:53:43,520
events that could be considered catastrophic   and catastrophic to the extent that were an 
event of an equivalent magnitude to occur now

897
01:53:45,680 --> 01:53:52,560
it would basically end civilization as we know 
it that's the criteria what would be what would  

898
01:53:52,560 --> 01:53:58,640
be the magnitude of an event that it would take 
to terminate our modern industrial civilization  

899
01:54:00,320 --> 01:54:06,159
that's the criteria that i used then i began to 
search through the record of all of the events  

900
01:54:06,160 --> 01:54:13,200
that would be of that magnitude or greater and 
the events that i found so far have been entered  

901
01:54:13,200 --> 01:54:20,080
onto this graph and they're listed all here you 
can see them and how many do we have here and this  

902
01:54:20,080 --> 01:54:27,040
is not complete necessarily but we have at least 
one two three four five six seven eight nine 10  

903
01:54:27,040 --> 01:54:38,480
11 12 13 14 15 16 of them in 150 000 years so at 
least 16 times in the last 150 000 years there  

904
01:54:38,480 --> 01:54:45,920
have been climate or environmental or geological 
catastrophes powerful enough that where they occur  

905
01:54:45,920 --> 01:54:53,199
to occur today would essentially put us back into 
the stone age but essentially if you think about  

906
01:54:53,200 --> 01:54:59,040
some of the small catastrophes we have seen in 
the last few years from the the destruction of  

907
01:54:59,040 --> 01:55:03,840
new orleans to the great tsunami you know to 
some of the big earthquakes that we've seen  

908
01:55:05,520 --> 01:55:11,120
you know new orleans is still not recovered but 
you've got to imagine what would happen if an  

909
01:55:11,120 --> 01:55:17,840
event that was one order of magnitude greater than 
katrina happened by that i mean 10 times worse  

910
01:55:18,400 --> 01:55:25,040
let's say that we had 10 cities decimated to the 
extent of new orleans we could certainly recover  

911
01:55:25,040 --> 01:55:31,600
from that but it would be a major effort to do 
so now what if we were talking about two orders  

912
01:55:31,600 --> 01:55:36,960
of magnitude let's say to put it into a rough 
equivalency an event that could could cause the  

913
01:55:36,960 --> 01:55:46,239
decimation of a hundred major urban areas could 
we recover from that questionable now let's go  

914
01:55:46,240 --> 01:55:51,840
three orders of magnitude and now we're talking 
about the equivalent of a thousand major cities  

915
01:55:52,480 --> 01:55:57,200
completely decimated okay at that 
level three orders of magnitude  

916
01:55:57,920 --> 01:56:02,640
that's what these are those are events that 
essentially would be three orders of magnitude

917
01:56:05,280 --> 01:56:14,800
once you begin to ponder this it 
becomes apparent why there isn't   a record an extant record of what's been going on 
for the whole time that we humans have been here  

918
01:56:16,160 --> 01:56:22,560
now at this point you probably haven't tied 
this in with what we've been saying before other  

919
01:56:22,560 --> 01:56:30,000
than i'll point out a few things to you that 
should be onset of the late wisconsin ice age  

920
01:56:31,680 --> 01:56:38,000
26 000 years before present remember 
the great year in the processional cycle

921
01:56:40,080 --> 01:56:45,920
add about 80 years to that we've got 26 000. of 
course 26 000 you consider a figure plus or minus  

922
01:56:45,920 --> 01:56:53,440
a few centuries now you come through that cosmic 
clock that i showed you right halfway to the  

923
01:56:54,400 --> 01:57:00,880
cusp of the age of leo twelve thousand nine 
hundred years ago roughly and what happened  

924
01:57:01,680 --> 01:57:12,000
we have something that happened twelve thousand 
nine hundred years before present on set of   the younger driest climate catastrophe 
first phase of the megafauna extinctions

925
01:57:15,600 --> 01:57:23,600
let's now here what i've done is i've entered 
some green dots now look at what the green dots  

926
01:57:23,600 --> 01:57:28,320
are the green dots are basically derived 
directly from the model of the great year  

927
01:57:28,880 --> 01:57:36,400
based upon cycles of six thousand four hundred and 
eighty twelve thousand nine hundred and sixty and  

928
01:57:36,400 --> 01:57:46,400
then twenty 25 920 and you'll notice how high of 
a correlation there is between the tempo of events  

929
01:57:47,600 --> 01:57:52,960
the actual events that have been derived by 
scientists without any reference to this great  

930
01:57:52,960 --> 01:58:00,000
year model at all and the timing of these ages of 
the world remember the six thousand four hundred  

931
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:05,680
and eighty years that was the uh the bull the 
lion the eagle and the man and according to the  

932
01:58:05,680 --> 01:58:13,760
traditions each of those seasons of the great year 
is inaugurated by some type of a great event a  

933
01:58:13,760 --> 01:58:22,320
transformative event a catastrophe if you will and 
what i've done here is i have developed a data set  

934
01:58:23,120 --> 01:58:30,720
that shows the correlation it certainly 
seems from a study of this graph that these  

935
01:58:30,720 --> 01:58:37,600
intervals these event nodes as i call them the 
susceptibility of something happening goes up  

936
01:58:37,600 --> 01:58:48,400
exponentially for a short period of 
time here's the analogy that i have used   you're out driving along a quiet country road 
you've got it on you know cruise control you're  

937
01:58:48,400 --> 01:58:59,920
kicking back you're listening to some tunes you're 
not paying much attention you know you're talking   on your cell phone not much traffic okay now 
you come up to a major highway and cars are  

938
01:59:00,960 --> 01:59:05,440
like this well you're crossing that intersection 
and while you're crossing that intersection  

939
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:16,080
now suddenly you got to put your cell 
phone down and start paying attention   because if you don't you're going to get t-boned 
right well obviously you've got your whole journey  

940
01:59:16,080 --> 01:59:23,680
and each time you cross an intersection of a major 
highway you know the potential of a catastrophe  

941
01:59:23,680 --> 01:59:28,000
increases considerably over what it 
would be while you're out there on the  

942
01:59:28,800 --> 01:59:36,239
lonely country road well you see our planet is 
on a cosmic highway around the galaxy and we're  

943
01:59:36,240 --> 01:59:41,360
now beginning to understand the fine structure of 
the galaxy and we realize that there is a pattern  

944
01:59:41,360 --> 01:59:48,560
and an order to it and there's a tempo of these 
orbital revolutions there's a tempo of the galaxy  

945
01:59:48,560 --> 01:59:55,920
and there's a wave pattern of the earth moving 
up and down above and below the galactic plane  

946
01:59:55,920 --> 02:00:03,040
and within that there are sub-orbital cycles as 
well and we also discover that there seems to be  

947
02:00:03,040 --> 02:00:10,880
a tempo in the delivery of cosmic matter to the 
inner solar system it doesn't seem to be random  

948
02:00:11,680 --> 02:00:19,520
and this is going to be beyond 
the scope of today's lecture   but what i'm getting at here is that 
the evidence now supports the conclusion  

949
02:00:20,080 --> 02:00:27,440
that the delivery of cosmic material and energy 
the energy pulses that would be affecting earth  

950
02:00:27,440 --> 02:00:33,199
are non-random that they're on some kind of 
a cosmic timetable a cosmic tempo if you will  

951
02:00:33,760 --> 02:00:39,199
and i think this is one of the most important 
insights we get from these ancient traditions is  

952
02:00:39,200 --> 02:00:45,120
the measurement of cosmic time and how it relates 
to us here on earth you just got to know what to  

953
02:00:45,120 --> 02:00:50,720
look for and where to look for it once you begin 
to become aware of it and you begin to see it  

954
02:00:50,720 --> 02:00:57,760
you begin to realize that the cosmic fingerprints 
are everywhere about us we're in fact living in  

955
02:00:57,760 --> 02:01:05,519
and upon the wreckage of the former worlds the 
rubble of these former worlds is all around us  

956
02:01:06,080 --> 02:01:12,960
but we haven't had the scale of perspective to 
see it and that's where we're at now i'm i'm  

957
02:01:12,960 --> 02:01:18,000
completely thrilled with things like the emergence 
of google earth because google earth is now  

958
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:23,280
allowing us to just somebody all of us to sit at 
our computers and see the cosmic perspective of  

959
02:01:23,280 --> 02:01:29,679
earth and when you look at it from you know from 
the from the extraterrestrial point of view things  

960
02:01:29,680 --> 02:01:34,800
begin to show up that we don't see when we're 
right down here immersed on it so close that we're  

961
02:01:34,800 --> 02:01:43,760
like ants walking under rubble and can't can't see 
what's around us but we do see that we literally  

962
02:01:43,760 --> 02:02:03,840
have built our own world and our own social system 
on top of and out of the wreckage of former worlds

963
02:02:29,120 --> 02:02:29,200
