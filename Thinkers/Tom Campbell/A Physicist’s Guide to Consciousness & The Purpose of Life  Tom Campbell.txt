00:00 I'll tell you there's only one truth but there's thousands of way that you can reach that truth but eventually you get
00:06 to the point that all of them converge to the same answer and that is the way reality is. I was working on my PhD. I
00:14 realized my mind had access to information that was unknown. That changed my whole life. Suddenly there
00:21 was this whole bigger piece of reality had nothing to do with the physical world. It was another whole set of
00:27 reality that had to do with consciousness. As a scientist, I wanted to know how did it work. At first, up
00:33 until just a year and a half ago, I would have told you that I had a reality model, not necessarily the model. But
00:39 after years and years and years, I realized that there wasn't any other answer. And the big breakthrough was
00:44 that what's the meaning of life? To become love, grow. That's why you're here. So, if you change gears on life,
00:51 your life gets better and better because now you're in this virtual reality leveling up and you'll find that you end
00:58 up happy.
01:05 Hey everyone, welcome back to the Know Thyself podcast. Our guest today is a former nuclear physicist who founded my
01:13 big theory of everything. uh his big toe, his big theory of everything is his
01:18 theory that unifies philosophy, physics, and metaphysics. And it has immense implications on the meaning of life and
01:27 how one might navigate their own life. As a reminder, as always, we have timestamps in the description that will
01:32 kind of walk us through exploring the theory to the different applications and implications around how one might live
01:39 life most effectively. and uh but I encourage you to kind of go through this chronologically as we're going to start
01:45 by building the foundation of his theory and then going deeper and higher from there. Thomas Campbell, thank you for
01:50 being here. Well, thank you for the invitation. You've been quite highly requested to come on this show and it's a it's a
01:57 pleasure to have you here now in the physical. So, thank you for making making the truck out. Well, thank you for your listeners uh uh
02:06 wanting me to come talk to them. That's good. It's always nice to talk to a friendly audience.
02:11 Yeah. Yeah. I think, you know, for everybody that's tuning in, not everyone's super familiar with your
02:17 theory and I I think it would be important just to start very baseline by asking what is a theory of everything
02:25 and then maybe you can share why you felt compelled to create your own. Well,
02:31 a theory of everything is just exactly what it sounds like. It's a theory that explains everything. When I mean when I
02:39 say explain, I mean it explains it as science would explain it. It gives a logical understanding
02:46 of how everything works, why it works that way and what are the what are the
02:54 interfaces, you know, what are all the logical conclusions of the of the basic theory and it
03:01 will create a better physics. It has it
03:06 explains things like quantum physics. Why should the reality be probability at
03:13 the base which is what quantum physics says you get down to the small particles and you don't find mass you don't find
03:20 little tiny pieces of mass at all matter of fact the the physicists say at a CERN
03:26 kind of atom smasher they'll tell you that if they assumed that a particle
03:31 like an electron was a little piece of mass with a charge they wouldn't get the right answers that's not what it is they
03:38 would tell you that the electron is a point with the attributes of charge
03:43 and the attributes of math. Mass that is how you would describe
03:50 an electron in a computer program and that is what the reality is. It really
03:58 is a computer program. So the physicists now have come to the realization that
04:04 reality is informationbased and they've come to that conclusion you
04:09 know a decade two decades ago for many of them. Now that's not all physicists that's the ones that are on the edge of
04:16 of quantum physics really the particle physicists and the quantum
04:23 theorists mostly. So if you dig down deep into
04:29 our reality, you find information. Now what does that mean? Well,
04:38 when you say you have information, that means that it's computable. That reality
04:44 is computable. An information system can create whatever information. You know
04:50 it's a very general information system can create any kind of information. So
04:55 that means our reality is computable. If it's computable then that means it
05:03 can be rendered in a computer. And if you think about it how else could
05:09 it be rendered? There aren't any other contenders. It's not like well it could be rendered in a computer and it there's
05:16 nothing else there. So it leaves us with basically a virtual reality that this
05:22 reality that we call the physical universe is really a virtual reality
05:28 computed. Now that's a real hard thing to wrap your mind around. And most
05:33 people hearing that will go, "Wow, this guy's bonkers." You know, that's impossible. It doesn't make any sense.
05:38 But it does make sense. But it's a big, you know, and time before we're done, it will have made sense. But um it's a huge
05:46 paradigm shift and I would say that it's the next big paradigm shift that will
05:53 occur in science, in philosophy, in theology, it affects everything. And
05:59 it's not just about science. If it were just about science like the other big
06:06 paradigm shifts, you know, we're not at the center of the universe. Well, they believe that because they didn't
06:11 understand that the Earth rotated on its axis. They saw the sun and the stars all come up and then set and then come up
06:18 again and set. So it looked like the earth was at the center and everything was going around us. It had to be in the
06:24 center. How else would everything go around us? But the earth turns on its axis. So that's how everything looks
06:31 like it's going around us. And then the flat earth versus the round earth. That
06:37 was another big paradigm shift. But those two paradigm shifts really only interested science types, philosophy
06:45 types. It didn't interest a guy in the street. You know, the guyy's trying to make a living and survive and get his crops in
06:51 and get him out in time and so on. He doesn't really care a whole lot about whether the earth's flat or whether it's
06:57 round or whether we're at the center of the universe or we're not. But this paradigm shift will affect everyone.
07:06 Matter of fact, it not only will produce a new, more general, more accurate physics, but it
07:14 also produces a logical
07:19 uh what do we call it? A logical map, a logical understanding of the subjective world as well as the objective world.
07:26 And we've never had that before. That's new. And it talks about things that are
07:32 important to that farmer that needs to get the crop in, about his life, about
07:38 his existence, about what his purposes, you know, what he should be doing. How do you level up in this game? You know,
07:45 all of those things are important. They affect your relationships. They affect
07:50 who you are and how you go about life, the choices you make. So this paradigm shift is
07:57 one that affects everyone and affects everyone uh very much greatly.
08:06 So you speak about this theory being inclusive of not just the objective world which the materialist
08:12 reductionists would be a proponent of of focusing on but also including the
08:18 subjective world and one cannot explore the subjective world without exploring the nature of consciousness. And I think
08:26 to start baseline and build our way up through your theory and its implications uh one cannot do that without exploring
08:32 the perspective of what consciousness is and uh its fundamental p uh aspect. So
08:39 uh walk us through that notion uh and then we can go from there. Well, the fundamental
08:45 uh if you will the the fundamental understanding that you need to approach
08:50 this theory of everything is that consciousness is fundamental. Everything
08:56 else is a derivative of consciousness. Now that idea
09:03 um used to be called let's see the
09:08 panist. No. Um, that's not the word I'm thinking of. There was the idealism. It was
09:14 called idealism. Idealism is an idea that what's really real is not this
09:20 physical world, but something behind this physical world. And Plato had his
09:27 famous uh, you know, allegory of the people in the cave and all they could see were their shadows on the wall and
09:33 they thought that those shadows were reality. They didn't understand the light behind them casting the shadows.
09:40 They didn't understand the bigger picture. So, they believe that they were the shadows on the wall. Well, that's
09:47 idealism. There's something else out there that's more fundamental than the
09:53 physical world. And of course, the Buddha said the same thing. He said, "This reality is maya. It's illusion."
09:60 And of course, it is. So, that's true as well. But once you understand
10:06 consciousness then you can derive physics from consciousness. I can derive and have
10:13 derived uh quantum physics and relativity both which are the two big gems of of physics. I can answer the
10:22 paradoxes in both of those sciences that they can't answer. There's a lot of questions there. Things they know are
10:28 true but they have no idea how or why that they're true. like why is the speed
10:33 of light a constant? Why is probability at the base of reality? You know these are things that
10:39 they don't know. What does it mean to say that the the wave you know the probability wave function collapses to a
10:45 particle? You know physicists are are uh they say things like that and of course it doesn't make any sense. Probability
10:52 is a mathematics. How does mathematics written on a piece of paper collapse to
10:58 a physical particle? That's nonsense. Of course, it doesn't happen. But it's a metaphor. And what it
11:06 looks like is that that happens. It looks like you have probability and then
11:12 suddenly you have a particle someplace that you measure, but it just looks like that. It isn't.
11:18 There's a big difference between what is and what things look like. A very big
11:23 difference. So consciousness is fundamental. And I have one assumption
11:28 in my model just one. and everything else is derived from that logically. And that assumption is that consciousness
11:36 exists. That's it. That's the sum total of all of my assumptions is that consciousness
11:42 exists. And what I did was I started with a
11:48 I started with the smallest piece of conscious like a consciousness cell if you will as a analogy to the the you
11:57 know the life and the fauna and the people and everything that's on this
12:02 planet starts with cells right cells the basic unit of life. So think of it as a as a reality cell or a consciousness
12:09 cell. And I define consciousness as
12:15 awareness with a choice. That's it. Very simple definition. It's awareness with a
12:22 choice. But that definition carries a whole lot of things with it. It carries
12:28 well the awareness that kind of comes in with the assumption of consciousness. That's what consciousness is. Awareness
12:35 and has a choice. So if you have a choice that means there was before the choice and after the choice. So time
12:40 comes in as logically necessary. If you're making a choice you have to
12:46 make it based on something and for some purpose. So you get input
12:52 and now we get input through our five senses and then we process that input and we
12:59 compare it to what we have in memory. So now we have processing we have memory.
13:04 Then we process it a little more and we get an output. What are we going to do about that input? You know, what does it
13:11 mean to us? What is its significance? So what do you know that has input
13:16 processing memory and then output? That's an information system. So I model
13:23 consciousness as an information system. And I look at all of the fundamental
13:32 functions of consciousness and I give them names. I made up names because I
13:37 didn't want to use the old names because they were associated with this group or that or this religion or that. And
13:43 rather than start those arguments, my gods smarter than your gods, you know, I
13:48 uh made up my own terms. So I start with a larger consciousness system. That's the whole system.
13:54 LCS. LCS, right? And then I'm kind of jumping ahead here, but it breaks into parts and
14:01 those are individuated units of consciousness with partition off a smaller piece which is a free will
14:07 awareness unit. So I come up with these these metaphors. Really, you have to
14:13 look at those as metaphors. Don't look at them as like physical objects. They're not objects. They're metaphors.
14:19 It's understanding. Talking about consciousness is a very abstract conversation. Our language is only good
14:26 for talking about things because it developed for us to communicate about
14:31 things, you know, each other being things, bodies, things in our environment, whatever. So, our language
14:37 is very material focused and doesn't really have the words and concepts to
14:42 talk a lot about what's not physical, which consciousness is not physical.
14:50 Consciousness is not created in a brain. Okay? So I I I'm skipping a lot of steps
14:58 here, but we can go back and fill them in as as you want to. So if you have the
15:03 very smallest piece of consciousness, it's basically an awareness that can be
15:08 aware of two things, A or B, one or zero. It's binary.
15:14 Okay, that's the smallest set of things you can be aware of. If you're only aware of one thing, then you wouldn't be
15:20 able to make a choice. You wouldn't have, you know, that wouldn't work. There's only one thing. Then you're
15:26 stuck. There's nothing you can do with that. So the smallest thing with a choice is two things. Now this awareness
15:34 can be in state one or state two, a one or a zero. So it can then it has memory. That's
15:44 part of awareness. Awareness has memory. If it doesn't have memory, then everything it's aware of is the first
15:50 thing it's ever been aware of. If there's no memory, so you can't build on that. If everything you're aware of is
15:56 the first thing you've ever been aware of, then you can't build anything with it. There's nothing to to build. You
16:03 have to build the next thing based on what you had before. So you see just that uh tiny concept of
16:11 awareness with a choice has all kinds of logical consequences to it. Time free
16:17 will you have to have free will because otherwise there's no choice without free
16:23 will if it's a force choice and it's not a free choice. It's not really a choice. It just happens. So you have free will,
16:31 you have time before and after and you have consciousness. And all three of those are logically necessary for each
16:38 other. Okay. So now we have conscious as an information system and it evolves.
16:44 How does a conscious how does a a conscious system how does an information system evolve? And I'm
16:51 going through kind of key steps that we're going to get there in a in a hurry and then we can we can flesh it out
16:56 later. So if you have an information system and if that information system
17:04 has all of its bits random then there's no information in that
17:09 system by the definition of random. If all the bits in the system are random there is no information. But if you take
17:17 some of those bits and order them make order out of those bits. So those three
17:22 bits together, you stack one on top the other, you know, you you make a little triangle out of them. You do something
17:28 that orders them. And now you have information. And that information can be a symbol for something, could stand for
17:34 something. It could be the the number four or the letter Z.
17:39 You have information. Now what you've done is you've lowered the entropy of the system. Entropy is a measure of
17:47 disorder. High entropy, lots of disorder. low entropy, less disorder. So
17:53 when you take all random bits and order some of them, you've lowered the entropy, you've created order. And from
18:00 that, you can see that this little consciousness cell, if you will, that's
18:07 just binary, it has memory. So it can remember that it was in a state A and
18:12 then a B and then another B and then an A and an A and a B and an A. And it can
18:17 start with its memory building patterns. And those patterns now are more order,
18:23 lower entropy. And those patterns can stand for something too. And you may
18:29 have this pattern and that pattern. And now you have two patterns. So and then you have four patterns. And you can
18:36 group those four patterns into two of two. So you you very quickly end up with
18:41 mathematics out of, you know, the patterns. It's kind of obvious. You just stumble into
18:48 mathematics because it's about quantity. Mathematics is nothing more than the
18:53 logic of quantity. And the reason math is so valuable to scientists who are
18:59 studying the physical world is that the physical world is totally in terms of quantity. How much does it weigh? How
19:05 what volume does it have? You know what's it composed of? It's all about quantity. So math describes those
19:12 things. It is the logic of quantity. That's what numbers are. Addition,
19:17 subtraction, multiplication, all of it is just the logic of quantity. So, math
19:23 is really good at describing things that are based on quantity. And it's really
19:28 poor at describing things that are based on quality. In the objective world, you
19:34 have quantity. In the subjective world, you have quality.
19:40 They're different things. So, what happens in the subjective world? Math doesn't seem to apply to that. Well, it
19:47 doesn't. When you have the objective world, you have an intellect that processes logic in that world. And when
19:53 you are in the intuitive side that's processing the subjective side, that is
19:59 just information comes in whole chunks. So our consciousness
20:05 has two ways of processing information. the intellectual side, the logic and the
20:12 intuitive side beyond logic. You just get the information. Now, as it turns out, of
20:19 course, in our culture, we really put high value on that intellect and people
20:24 earn rewards in the in the society based on how well they can use that intellect,
20:30 how they can apply it. And our intuitive side is neglected almost entirely.
20:36 Matter of fact, science will tell you that there is no such thing as an intuitity side. Intuition is all just
20:42 bogus nonsense. You had that idea all along. You just didn't know. Yeah, they they kind of say
20:49 that's not there. But this model also describes very clearly everything
20:54 paranormal, why it happens, what the mechanism is, and everything paranormal
20:60 happens on the intuitive side. Nothing paranormal ever happens on the intellectual side. That's where all
21:06 that's where the spiritual side is also. It's over there on the intuitive side. So anyway, I've let me get back onto the
21:15 subject here. So we have these cells of reality let's say of consciousness
21:22 and it is expanding its memory and expanding
21:27 its its uh its patterns and
21:33 then it finds out that it can just switch between a one and a zero or an A or a B back and forth back and forth and
21:40 it's just created a metronome. Oh, now there's not only time that you have because before the choice and after the
21:47 choice, but now you have a thing called regular time. And now it can not only make patterns, it can make sequences
21:55 and sequences of patterns and patterns are sequences. And it can get more and more complex. As it gets more complex,
22:02 there's more order, it's lowering its entropy. So we come to a very basic thing in my model and that is an
22:09 information system consciousness evolves by lowering its entropy.
22:16 And the entropy just isn't putting all you know all the the the bits in a row.
22:22 That's a very low order of entropy. It's the meaning the significance of those bits. So you discover mathematics and
22:28 arithmetic and adds you know addition and subtraction and which leads to algebra which leads to calculus which
22:35 leads to differential equations which goes on and on. All of that then comes
22:41 later. It's all again the logic of quantity. So all those things will develop from this one consciousness
22:49 cell. Now, there's two ways to think of this, and they both go to exactly the same place, and they're they're
22:54 equivalent entirely. One of them is the cell that just keeps growing and expanding and evolving, and everything
23:01 that happens is all part of its memory. You know, Hawkings said in this last
23:08 line of his book, he said, um, perhaps we're all just, you know, a flicker in
23:14 the mind of God. Well, that's something like that. It's just this one thing and we're part of that vast memory in the
23:22 mind of God. But the other way is that those little conscious cells do what biological cells
23:28 did. they split. Now you've got two and then four and then eight and then they
23:35 cooperate and connect and work with each other and eventually you end up something like us say that we did in
23:42 biology with what four trillion cells all cooperating with each other. Each
23:47 one of those cells is sort of like a bacterium. So we're our bodies are
23:53 composed of trillions of bacteria if you like that are all cooperating with each
23:59 other. So now we have the idea that consciousness
24:06 is an information system. The information system evolves to states of lower entropy. Okay. Now it grows and
24:14 evolves and keeps evolving to lower and lower entropy and eventually it hits a plateau because what it needs is new
24:21 possibilities to evolve into, you know, new ways, new patterns, new sequences,
24:26 new ways of looking at things. Well, it kind of hits a plateau because it's just one mind. It's one monolithic
24:33 consciousness and it can only think what it can think. So
24:40 what it does is the same thing cell did you know we had a lot of little one-shelled creatures and what they did
24:47 is that they create it created something else out of itself.
24:54 It took a subset out of itself. So you have this large kind of system monolithic takes a subset out of itself
25:01 which means it partitions off some memory and some processing and whatever in computer terms we call that a what a
25:08 um virtual machine inside the main frame. You know that's how thousands of
25:14 people can log onto a mainframe because each person gets a little chunk of memory gets a you know gets a chunk of
25:19 processing and so on and that's a virtual computer inside a big computer. So it partitions off a piece of itself
25:27 and gives that piece of itself free will that it can make choices as well. It has
25:32 all the stuff it needs to make choices. It is processing and so on. So now it has free will. Well, when you have
25:39 multiple things all with free will, they begin to diverge. They end up having
25:45 different experiences, different ways of seeing things, different attitudes. So it makes thousands, tens of thousands,
25:51 millions of these things and they all have free will. Now you have arguments
25:57 and discussions and challenges and that creates another
26:03 much larger set of possibilities because the possibilities of the group are much
26:09 greater than the possibilities of the monolithic thing. Okay, now we're getting closer and
26:16 closer to the kind of us. So those little pieces, I call them individuated
26:22 units of consciousness. They're just subsets of the larger system and they
26:27 have all the same properties of the system. They're just smaller, not as much processing, you know, not as much
26:32 memory. They're just a smaller unit. So they can evolve themselves to be as low
26:39 entropy as the system itself, but they'll never be as big because they're
26:45 subsets. Okay? But they can be as good. They can lower their entropy as well. So
26:54 that's that's us. We are these individuated units of consciousness. Now
26:59 the first virtual reality that this system made now it's a system. It's got the the big conscious still there but a
27:06 lot of subsets that have free will. The first virtual reality and and a virtual
27:12 reality is basically a rule set. Everybody in this, everybody that joins this game has to obey by these rules
27:19 that defines a virtual reality. First virtual reality was communication protocols. How could they communicate
27:26 with each other? Well, you need vocabulary and syntax and all that sort of thing. So that was the first
27:31 virtuality. Join this group and you get to communicate by these rules. You abide
27:37 by the by those rules. You can change the rules, but you have to have rules for the communication. But the second
27:43 virtual reality was all of those individuated units of consciousness with
27:48 their free will. They needed to make better choices. They needed to make
27:54 choices that lowered their entropy. Okay? That's what that's what
28:01 consciousness does. It's an information system. It low it evolves by lowering its entropy. It's hard to lower your
28:07 entropy in what I call a big chat room. all these little pieces of conscious they can all communicate with each other
28:12 now but they could say whatever they wanted to say you know there wasn't a whole lot of traction or a whole lot of
28:18 significance in that and they grew up very slowly so the larger consciousness
28:24 system that was the the daddy of them all the father if you will it um decided
28:32 it had to create another virtual reality but one that had a very tight role set
28:37 one that would define Every interaction every interaction would be defined and
28:44 every interaction could affect every other reaction. In other words, it's a tight rule set which what is the way our
28:52 universe what we call the physical universe is a virtual reality with a tight rule set. Everything
28:58 has a certain energy, right? A certain momentum, a certain state vector. It can
29:04 do things. But when it does things, let's say if it moves its energy this way, then that affects somebody over
29:11 there and that thing then responds to that. And when it responds, it changes,
29:17 you know, interacts with people next to it and so on. So it's a very interactive
29:22 space where everything requires a energy exchange of some sort. So it's very
29:29 interactive. Now it creates this virtual reality not like
29:35 we create virtual realities. We program them. This one was created
29:41 by coming up with a rule set and a set of initial conditions, punching the run
29:46 button and let the initial conditions change according to the rules. And we do
29:51 this in computer science labs. You know, we've been doing that for 20 years in computer science labs where you come up
29:56 with rule set and conditions and you see where it goes and then you play with the conditions and play with the rule set
30:02 and it goes different places. So it did that and I call that the big digital
30:07 bang and the initial conditions were a ball of plasma, high temperature, high
30:13 pressure and when the run button was hit, it expanded according to the rule set and you've all heard the big bang.
30:19 It expands. that create suns and planets and so on. So that's the you know that's
30:25 the big digital bang so to speak. So that our reality then evolved
30:31 as a simulation in a computer based on a rule set and
30:37 initial conditions. Now that rule set is what scientists are supposed to do. They
30:44 dig out the rules. What are the rules in this virtual reality? Well if I flat my arms am I going to fly? No, rule set
30:51 doesn't support it. You know, oh, I get brain damage because I fell off a cliff.
30:56 Maybe I no longer have memory. And maybe I drag my left foot when I walk because of that. Well, that's because the rule
31:03 set says that with that damage, that would be the consequence. You see? So,
31:09 this virtual reality perked along until it developed entities within the virtual reality
31:17 by evolution. So it evolved again. Stars, suns, planets, earth, you know,
31:23 biological cells, plants, animals, people all got developed.
31:30 Now, here's a interesting uh part of this. You have
31:37 these entities interacting and they evolve by lowering their entropy. Now,
31:43 I'm going to associate lowering your entropy with love. There's a connection
31:48 between lowering entropy and love. Take a group of people
31:54 that and another group of people that's identical. Put them all in a separate space. And this group of people, let's
32:01 say, are the love group. They all care about each other. They're all helpful. They're all interested in in
32:08 being part of the solution for everybody. Okay? And here's the fear group over here. They're fearful. When you're
32:15 fearful, you don't trust. Uh when you're fearful, you it's all about you. You
32:21 become very self-centered. You want to grab whatever you can grab and fight to fight to keep it and so on. So, you let
32:27 these two groups just evolve and see where they go. Well, what do you think? Which one is the low entropy and the
32:33 high entropy? It's rather obvious, isn't it? The low entropy group will optimize. They will optimize whatever resources
32:40 they have for all the people involved. That's the low entropy solution. The
32:46 fear group will initially they'll just beat each other up for a while to try to
32:53 get each other's stuff because it's all about them self-centered. Then they'll realize that there's powers in numbers
32:59 and they'll group up into various groups. Now this group can take a lot of stuff because there's 20 people in that
33:05 group and they can beat up all sorts of people with that power. So then another one gets 20 for a defense against that
33:10 group and then another one and and so on it goes and eventually enough time you
33:16 end up with what we have in our world which is a fear-based world for the most part. You have a lot of uh groups,
33:22 nation states we call them, and u it's all about offense and defenses, you
33:28 know, how much can you get and can you can you keep it and hold it. So you end up with that kind of a reality and
33:35 that's a very high entropy. High entropy means that you don't have optimal solutions. It means that what uh you
33:43 know 90% of the resources are controlled by 5% of the people and you have
33:50 hierarchy the people on top and levels and so on. So it turns out kind of like us. So that tells you that consciousness
33:58 this this um is modeled best by an information system and consciousness
34:04 evolves to lower its entropy. Consciousness evolves toward love,
34:09 toward cooperation, caring, sharing. That's how consciousness evolves. That's
34:15 the direction. So I said you make choices. Conscious makes choices. Well,
34:21 if it makes those choices toward becoming love, then it evolves. If it
34:26 makes those choices toward becoming fearful, it deevolves. So now you have
34:32 consciousness with free will that can evolve or dee evolve based on its own free will choices.
34:38 Now we'll go back to connecting that with the virtual reality. So now this virtual
34:46 reality that is just evolving ends up with monkeys and people and whales and
34:52 everything in it all those entities can be conscious.
34:58 How do you get to be conscious? how to you know you and I end up with consciousness it's because some some
35:05 piece of consciousness the things I called the the individuated units of consciousness take a subset of
35:11 themselves and log it on to an avatar
35:17 but the system had to wait until the avatars were capable of making ethical
35:23 and moral choices choices that were between low entropy and high entropy choices. So, it got to humans and that
35:30 was good. Now, did the system meddle a little bit that process? Sure, we all do
35:35 that. You know, it was going along and we wasn't getting any good avatars. So,
35:40 it probably meddled a little here and meddled a little there to make it come out the way it wanted it to. But for the
35:46 most part, it just let it run. If you just let things run, then it's completely coherent. Everything, you
35:52 know, kind of like has its cause. You don't have suddenly things change. So that tells us who are we? We're
36:01 pieces of consciousness. We are logged on to a human avatar.
36:08 That avatar is computed. Same as avatar in a computer game. Okay.
36:15 Now if you play a computer game of some kind of virtive
36:23 there, only two things that are real. One, the computer. and to the player.
36:28 The actual game, the World of Warcraft, the elves and the barbarians or the sin characters, pardon my old view of
36:36 virtual reality games. I'm not up to uh current times with that. My memory
36:42 goes back to what my kids played and my kids are all now 40 or approaching 40. So, I go back a ways. But anyhow,
36:50 you have just two things, the the computer and the player that are active real things. The virtual reality is just
36:57 computed. It's eye candy. It gives you something to look at so that you can tell what's going on in the game. If you
37:03 had to look at a print out and figure it out, it would be hopeless. But they make a nice pretty picture of what's going on
37:09 and who's doing what, then you can look at it and at a glance kind of understand the environment you're in and what your
37:15 choices are. Okay? So, if you're playing that game, let's say you're you're an
37:21 elf in some game. Well, let's say you're an elf and you're aware, or at least you
37:26 think you're aware. Where would the computer be? A computer would be
37:32 non-physical because to the elf that virtual reality is what's physical.
37:38 So, the computer would be non-physical. And what would the player be? Well, you
37:44 think you're the player. I'm the player. I'm the elf. But the player has to talk
37:51 to the computer. Elves and virtual realities can't talk to the computer. They're computed by the
37:56 computer. Connected to the larger consciousness system connected to the larger. Yes. So it's a
38:02 piece of consciousness has to talk the two things that are passing data back and forth is the free
38:09 will awareness unit which is really a piece of the individual unit of consciousness. It's talking to the
38:15 computer. It gets a data stream. It looks at that data. It interprets it as this reality. Okay? Just like you look
38:22 at a a million dots of light on your screen, or if you got a really good screen, maybe two million dots of light
38:27 on your screen, and you look at all those dots, and each dot has a color, a
38:32 brightness, and a position. That's it. You got three pieces of information for every dot. You look at all those
38:39 millions of dots, and you see streams and rivers and barbarians and houses and
38:44 doorork knobs on the doors of those houses. And the rule set says you have to turn the doororknob before the door
38:49 will open. and you abide by the rule set. So that's that's a very quick idea
38:59 that that says what we are. We're in a virtual reality. Consciousness is the
39:04 computer. Consciousness is an information system. So it can take a piece of itself and configure it as a
39:11 computer to be the rendering engine for this virtual reality. So that the pieces
39:16 of consciousness can make choices that are meaningful and significant and carry
39:22 a lot of weight. And by those choices that they make, they evolve positively
39:27 toward love or they evolve backwards. They evolve toward fear. So that's kind
39:35 of the overall model. Now, as crazy as that sounds,
39:41 I got there not because I sat down one day and and thought this all up. I got there because
39:51 at around I don't know, in my early I don't know, really my middle 20s,
39:57 myself and a and a fellow that worked with me, Dennis Menick, we uh got with Bob Monroe.
40:03 Yeah. Tom, before we jump into that that story, because I think it's actually really important to see how you arrived
40:09 at this point, just as a recap, because we covered I know which is probably the tip of the
40:15 iceberg of your theory and understanding of it all, but to to help kind of
40:21 me digest and everybody digest the the the overview of what you just gave, we
40:27 started at the fact that consciousness is fundamental. Yes. And that because we can observe
40:32 that reality is information-based, we could extrapolate that there is a larger consciousness system that has a rule set
40:39 of time, space and matter which within we are exempted
40:46 units of consciousness. And within this reality, the perception of evolution is
40:51 to move from fear to love. And by lowering entropy, we evolve. And so when
40:58 you're when we're reflecting on who we are, what this reality is, we could we could pick apart many of those things.
41:06 But uh what's interesting to me is what's in our apparent differences
41:12 of ethnicity and and the place we were raised in and the memory that we accumulated and the illusion of
41:19 separation between Tom and Andre that they feel like two separate things. What's unanimous within both of our
41:26 experience is that there is an experience of awareness that individuated unit of of awareness of
41:32 consciousness that you spoke to and how in recognizing that we see how we are
41:37 much more alike than we are different. Yes. Matter of fact, that old saying that says we're all one is a fact. We
41:44 are we all come from the same system. We're all pieces of consciousness from
41:50 one system. So we really are all individ individuated pieces of one thing
41:58 and you came to this experientially first because you were a nuclear physicist who was on your path very much
42:04 so in the side of logic how you spoke to there's two paths of knowing intuition and logic you are on the path very much
42:11 so of the intellect and then you got exposed to these practices via Bob Monroe and um TM and uh walk us through
42:19 your journey of how you arrived there. Okay. Um yeah, I was um had a masters
42:25 already working on my PhD and in those were the bad old days of computing where
42:31 there were punch cards and debugging software was a really hard thing to do because they didn't have debugging
42:37 software and they didn't have uh anything other than I'm sorry your job didn't run. That's all the information
42:43 you'd get. So I found just after learning how to meditate, I did TM
42:49 learned how to meditate. It was very easy for me. I picked up on it instantly. And I found that I could go
42:54 into a meditation state, let the um the print out of my cards, my punch cards,
43:02 which would be like a listing on a computer uh roll, and I could see that
43:08 where the cards were that had a problem that were creating errors. It would just appear in your awareness. It would just appear in my awareness. I
43:15 mean, I'd actually see the list. I'd see the most of it's black and oh, here'd be a a red line and I'd back back up and
43:21 I'd look at it and I'd recognize the line cuz I wrote all the code. So, you would gain cognition of information that was not derived through
43:28 the intellect. Exactly. But it was still valid. Yes. And at first when I did that, I thought, well, that's fun, but it
43:34 probably doesn't work. And I went and I found that it did work. It was precise.
43:40 And I started playing with it more. And it got easier and better as I went. And
43:46 I could even find errors in those cards that had nothing to do with my
43:51 programming. They were errors in positioning the hole that the that the
43:56 card punch punch. If it's a tenth of a millimeter in the wrong space, it's
44:01 unreadable by the computer. And that's because both the cards or the bugs and
44:07 yourself as a unit of consciousness share both uh in that information stream
44:14 like that that data stream you both have access to because people I would just love for and you can continue to go
44:19 through your story but how it's physically possible or non-physically possible that you could have access to
44:26 something uh beyond the intellect. Yes. Well, you that way that information is in a database and
44:34 the database is is required in order to render the virtual reality. In order to
44:40 render this virtuality, it needs certain information to do the rendering and we can get into that later. You know, how
44:46 does the system know what's going to happen next? Because this is not a bottom up where the last set creates the
44:53 next set. This is probability. So, the system has to know how to do that. It does it with a random draw from a
44:59 probability distribution of the possibilities. So it has to know what the possibilities are and it has to know
45:04 what's the probability of each of those possibilities and that's the data set that's available. Now the ancient Hindus
45:11 called that the Aashic records and as far as they know it just was there because it was there. I know why it's
45:18 there because it's necessary to run the
45:23 virtual reality for the rendering engine has to have that information or it can't run the virtuality. So I tapped into
45:28 that and everything is there because everything is rendered. Everything here,
45:34 everything physical, including those cards and the key punch and the holes and everything's being rendered and the
45:41 machine that that reads those cards, all of that's being rendered and it's according to the the rule set. So all
45:49 the information is there and you can connect to that information with your
45:55 consciousness because that's all in consciousness. You really are a piece of consciousness. So you're you're part of
46:01 that consciousness system and the information is available to you but it's
46:06 not available to you through your intellect. It's available to you through your intuition. You connect to it kind
46:13 of mindto mind if you will. You make a connection to that that database and
46:19 it's like any other database. You can query it and you get answers and then you refine your query and you'll get
46:24 better answers and refine it again. Have you found that's all is necessary like the intention or when you say set a
46:31 query? Yes, that's all that's necessary. That's the only intention with a conscious. An intention
46:38 of a conscious is the as we say in physics the motive force. It's the thing that makes things happen. It's the only
46:45 active ingredient. With that intention you can heal. That intention you can get
46:51 data of the database. With that attention you can go visit a past life. With that intention, you can uh do
46:59 pretty much anything because you're a piece of consciousness. You have access to the data that's in conscious. You can
47:05 explore that larger consciousness system. Hey guys, a quick share about creatine. I'm not sure how many of you
47:13 know about or consistently take creatine, but I have genuinely noticed the effects it has had on supporting my
47:19 training, workout, building muscle, and also my mind supplementing with it the past year. It's not just for gym bros
47:26 like a lot of people think. If you don't know, creatine, which is comprised of three amino acids, is not just for
47:32 muscle. It's essential daily fuel for your brain, your body, and your long-term health. Momentous is the gold
47:39 standard in creatine because they source Creapure creatine, which is the purest,
47:45 most effective creatine monohydrate available, single sourced from Germany and not cut with any fillers or junk.
47:51 Their new lemon flavor single serve travel packs are amazing. They make it easy to stay consistent. You just mix it
47:58 with water and it tastes amazing. If you're curious about trying them out, you can head to livemus.com
48:04 and use code know thyself for up to 35% off your first order. That's know thyself momentous.com. Link in
48:11 description. As always, I hope you like it. Hope you enjoy. Back to the show. As
48:16 a quick aside, is there a unique relationship between the information in the data stream and geometry? I'm
48:23 curious how like is is that information in because a lot of people have experiences of geometric shapes and you
48:30 know and mystical experiences where there's inherent information seeming embedded in in geometric shapes.
48:36 Well, there is information based in geometric shapes, but that information
48:41 is mostly in the form of mathematics and quantity, you know. geometry, the
48:46 symmetry itself, you know, is has information. How many sides does it have? How long is each side? You know,
48:53 and they all have to add up to a circumference. So, are the sides regular or are they irregular? So, all of that
48:59 is information that defines the figure. But no, there's nothing inherent in geometry that is,
49:07 you know, that is between you and the information. Let's put it that way. Now how that information is stored, how the
49:15 LCS stores that, what form is it stored in, you know, is it like we store
49:20 information in bits or do they have some other more elegant and efficient way of
49:26 storing information? Well, I don't know that. All I know is that the information is there and it's not geometry
49:33 dependent. But why would people get this, you know, and it happens a lot,
49:38 get these geometric things? Well, g the geometric shapes
49:44 are a metaphor for order. They're a metaphor for purpose. In other words,
49:49 you don't get hexog out of randomness. If you see geometric shapes and you see
49:56 things are made of that, to me that's a metaphor for saying this is purposeful.
50:02 This is ordered, coherent. There is coherence here and structure. And that's really the metaphor. Not so
50:08 much that that hexog has special meaning in and of itself other than it's a good
50:13 metaphor for the structure and the coherence of consciousness. So it tells
50:20 us that a lot of things that we get from the larger conscious system are
50:25 metaphorical. Mostly they're metaphorical. So I it's usually an error if you look at it as
50:33 precise thing. You have to look at it more as a as a metaphor, something that
50:39 gives you a sense of a of a bigger thing. It's it's symbolic. Our dreams are that way. When we dream, we
50:46 sometimes dream in details, but basically our dreams are metaphors that we can interpret. Oh, this means that
50:52 and this person was a symbol for this other thing. And you know, they're metaphorical.
50:57 and that your connections with the larger conscious system when you're particularly if you're asking questions,
51:04 they have a a kind of a strong metaphorical bias to them. If you're asking very specific questions like
51:10 where's the error in this line, you know, well then you get a very specific answer. You don't get a metaphor. You
51:16 get an answer that says, you know, re repunch the card, retype in, you know,
51:22 the card punch and get a new card and that'll fix the problem. So you get that as a as an answer.
51:27 So then what happened to you as you were experiencing these things? Well, like I say, I was working on my
51:32 PhD at the university. Uh I realized my mind had access to information that was
51:39 unknown, unknowable even. How could you can't look at a card and say, "Oh, that
51:45 hole isn't there. It's it's a tenth of a millimeter, you know, one way or another." And that's totally impossible
51:53 to see that visually. So it wasn't just that it was getting information somehow
51:59 out of the depth of my own consciousness that I knew when I punched that key that it was going to be wrong. It obviously
52:07 knew things that that were information that was unavailable. Period.
52:12 Unavail unavailable. Well, if you'd have got a bunch of people together and say, "What's wrong with this line of code?"
52:18 They would said nothing. And then maybe you would concluded, "Well, let's repunch it and see if it was an error."
52:24 But there's nothing looking at it would tell you it was an error. So that was information that
52:30 was obviously not out of the physical world. And at that point, that changed
52:35 my whole life. I said, "Oh, I'm a physicist. What physicists do is we model reality. That's our job is to
52:42 model reality." And suddenly there was this whole bigger piece of reality that
52:48 I was just starting to get a glimpse of and had nothing to do with the physical world. It was another whole set of
52:55 reality that had to do with mind and with consciousness. And as a scientist,
53:01 I wanted to know how did it work? What could you do? What else could I do with it? And I was inquisitive. So I played
53:08 with it. And two or three years later, I got out of school. I went to work, met
53:14 Dennis Mick, ran into Bob Monroe, and now I'm 26, 27, something like that. And
53:23 I'm spending now 15 to 20 hours a week with Bob Monroe. And he's teaching
53:30 myself and Dennis how to go out of body, how to connect intuitively.
53:35 And we do that and we get to the point that we can do it exactly whenever we want to. It's not a long process. It's a
53:42 short process. You can go from aware here to aware someplace else in fractions of a second and still be here.
53:48 You can parallel process more than one reality. So I learned all these things and how to reproduce it pretty exactly
53:56 so that I could do science there. So I could say, okay, I've learned how to heal people and it works. I've healed
54:03 200 people and some of them you don't know. Maybe their headache got better anyway. You know, you don't really know.
54:09 But other times somebody who hasn't walked for 10 years and are told that
54:15 they'll never walk again and you work on them and they get up and dance, you know. So you get things like that and
54:21 suddenly that's very evidential. But it just happened once, maybe it was a fluke. So you keep doing it. Eventually
54:27 you get the idea that you're able to heal. So you start you start doing I
54:32 started doing research on it. Well, if I change this variable, how does that affect the result and sometimes it would
54:38 have a negative effect, sometimes a positive effect, sometimes no effect at all. And 35 years later, I had a real
54:46 good idea how all the paranormal stuff worked because I was able to do it and do research like that with what what
54:53 could I do differently and how would that affect the result. So I came up with a models of all the paranormal
55:01 things and then I'm I was um actually then I wrote the books and the book was
55:08 mainly a thesis on consciousness and I knew that it also had to derive the
55:14 physical because I knew consciousness was fundamental. I knew conscious had to lead to science but I didn't exactly
55:21 know how. And then about 3 years after I published the books, it came to me. A friend I was working with said something
55:27 to me that just was the right word at the right time and it jarred my mind and I go, "Oh, that's how it works." And
55:34 then after that I got quantum physics, I got relativity and I started solving
55:39 all the things both in philosophy and physics and some things in psychology
55:45 and you know metaphysics. They all fell into place. Everything made sense,
55:51 including the paranormal. So, I had all these these puzzle pieces that I had
55:57 gathered in 30 years of of spending probably, you know, 20 hours a week
56:04 working on it. It's like a half-time job. And it had a hundred or thousand puzzle pieces. I knew this was true and
56:10 that was true and that was true. But what would pull them all together? So they all worked out of you know from one
56:17 idea one conception had pulled them all together and it had to include all the physical stuff I knew as a physicist all
56:23 that had to also fit together with the one idea and then when the the solution to quantum physics came then all the
56:30 rest of it poured in within the next 6 months it just all fell you know as the
56:35 pieces go together it's easier to fit the pieces in the hardest part is the first you know the first 10 parts of the
56:41 puzzle are really difficult but the more you get it done the easier it is to fill in the other parts. So, the other parts
56:46 filled in pretty quickly. And at first, up until just probably a year and a half
56:53 ago, I would have told you that I had a model, a reality model, not necessarily
57:00 the model. I'd just come up with this model and it worked worked really well, but I didn't have an idea that maybe
57:07 something else might work better. But after years and years and years
57:14 searching for that other thing, searching for a flaw, what is it in my model that doesn't work? What is in
57:21 there that is not logical? Is there anything it does not explain? And if so,
57:27 why? What's the hangup? And years and years of searching for problems, I
57:32 didn't find any. And eventually, I realized that there wasn't any other
57:37 answer. This was the only answer that come out because it was logical. There wasn't any other way to get to the same
57:44 thing. Now, you could get to the same thing with different metaphors. You know, I'll tell you there's only one
57:49 truth, but there's thousands of way that you can reach that truth. There's not just one path to that truth. Thousands
57:55 of ways to reach that truth, but eventually you get to the point that all of them converge to the same answer. And
58:03 that is the way reality is. That's then the truth. And all of the other ways can
58:09 be explained based on that truth. And all the other ways are are useful.
58:14 They're all helpful. There isn't just one path to take to the truth. Lots of paths will lead you to the truth. But
58:21 there is just one truth because that's the truth. You know, the truth isn't uh,
58:26 you know, a double or triple function. All three of these are the truth. No, there's just one that's the truth. So
58:34 that was how I ended up here is I had all of this experience out of body. You
58:39 know, I did all the things paranormal. I, you know, I have I'd let something talk through me.
58:45 You know, I did that kind of thing. I would uh, you know, we'd go up and have
58:51 a microphone over our lips and we'd tell Bob what we were experiencing and he would give us suggestions of what to do
58:56 or or what to ask for or something. And so he was in the control room and Dennis and I were in these isolation booths.
59:03 Matter of fact, the booth that I was in was also a Faraday cage. It was isolated from all electromagnetic fields as well.
59:11 And if you do that thousands of times, you get not only pretty good at it, but you get to understand
59:19 why things work the way they do because you tried it enough different ways that
59:24 you understand what works and what doesn't and why. and you can explore those differences. So that's what I did
59:30 eventually led me to the bigger picture for everything. It uh the big breakthrough I was about twothirds way
59:37 writing my book and the big breakthrough was that that uh consciousness was an
59:42 information system. I didn't start with that. I ended up with that because that's the one thing that tied all the
59:48 pieces together and then bingo all these pieces fell into and there's the picture you know. So it uh it took me a lot of
59:55 years. This wasn't a quick quick um
60:00 you know trail to this model. It took a lot of time but I'm a scientist. I'm a
60:07 physicist. So I don't mind going slowly. It has to be logical. It has to be such
60:13 that I can describe it to another scientist and they can end up with the same conclusion. So though the the the
60:21 leap is large, you know, it's it's a new paradigm and that paradigm is is huge, but it works
60:30 and it does answer these questions in physics. It is a
60:36 better physics. It describes things that the physics knows are true but can't can't understand. It's also like I say,
60:44 it's a model of the subjective as well. If you're unhappy or you're sad or
60:49 you're struggling, it can tell you why. And it can tell you what you need to do to not be unhappy and struggling and
60:55 what's causing that. And it's interesting because of course the Buddha,
61:03 you know, you know, Jesus, Muhammad, all of the
61:09 big stars. And I guess uh La Su, you know, was also he wasn't the the only
61:15 one, but in the in the DAO, you know, all of these got to the same answer.
61:21 When as all the dust settles, I'm not saying anything. It hasn't been said at least four times by, you know, different
61:27 people. It's all the same stuff because they got to that truth, but they got there
61:33 and explained it to what I would call poetry. You have to know how to interpret it. had have to know how to
61:41 interpret their words. A materialist reads the words that the Buddha said, "This is all maya. It's all an
61:46 illusion." They go, "Nonsense. Physical world is the physical world. This is, you know, this is the stuff." So, if you
61:54 can't interpret the words, then it's just poetry. You know, you read the Baham Vita and there's some guy on a
62:00 chariot fighting a war and what the hell does that mean and what's going on there? But if you understand what's
62:06 being said, the poetry that that you have to interpret, then it can be a very
62:12 meaningful discussion of life and and connections with other people and thinking and attitudes. There's a lot of
62:19 things there that are very important. But my work, I wanted to not have people
62:26 have to interpret it. I wanted to be logically clear so that the leftrainers
62:32 in the world, those logical process people that have to go from A to B logically or they can't get there,
62:38 that's an order ramp for them. So the logical process people can get the My Big Trilogy and find themselves being
62:46 having a good understanding of the paranormal, of um spirituality,
62:53 the nature of our reality, why things work the way they do. And they not only will find better physics, but they'll
62:59 find themselves in there. And they'll find what's their mission. What are they here for? What's the meaning of life?
63:06 Well, the meaning of life is to lower your entropy, to grow, to become love.
63:11 That's why you're here. You're here in an entropy reduction trainer. And just like a flight trainer, you know, that
63:17 the pilots get into, this is an entropy reduction trainer run by the larger consciousness system. and we interact
63:24 with each other creating challenges for each other and the way we
63:31 the way we make choices is what really counts. So, you know,
63:37 most people run their life this way. They try to manipulate what's going to happen. Well, I want my kids to grow up
63:42 and be professionals. I want my wife to, you know, do this and that and be a really good cook. You know, I want to do this. So you kind of have these ideas
63:49 and you're constantly applying a little pressure here and a little pressure there and manipulating information trying to make the world come out the
63:55 way you know it's best and the way that's good for everybody from your own viewpoint
64:01 and you're constantly struggling because it never works. You know you uh that's
64:08 not a good way to approach life. A better way is let whatever happens happens. And what's important is not
64:15 what happens, but how you deal with it. That's what's important. So if you
64:21 change the gears on life, stop trying to make it come out the way you know is best for yourself and everybody else and
64:28 just let it be and deal with it positively. Deal with it. Find the find
64:33 the low entropy path there as best you can. And if you can't and you're wrong, you make a a higher entropy choice.
64:41 Well, that's okay. No penalty. The whole point is learning. What's the problem is if you don't
64:47 learn. If it's a failure to learn, then that is not so good. But making
64:53 mistakes, coming up with the wrong answer, that's fine. That's the path of learning. We learn from making mistakes.
64:60 So I think this is the low entropy path and I take it. No, you know, it creates a lot of trouble. Then I have to think
65:06 about that. Why did I miss that? Why didn't I understand that that trouble is
65:12 was likely to happen? And then I learned from it. It was something about me. Probably some fear I had or some of the
65:19 blinder on that I didn't see that as a possibility or or I didn't understand
65:25 those people very well. I was I was judging them and oh here's the way they are and here's the way they work and
65:30 that judgment was all wrong. So that tells me to stop judging people. So you learn from it and then your life gets
65:38 better and better because now you're in this virtual reality leveling up doing
65:43 what you should be doing growing becoming love and you'll find that you
65:49 end up happy most of the time you smile life is good it doesn't matter so much what happens it's all how you deal with
65:56 it that matters what are some other telltale signs that you're living in alignment with the
66:02 larger consciousness system uh If it is the primary purpose to lower entropy, uh
66:10 if one is doing that, what would be the byproducts of that in life? Well, one really easy way to kind of
66:17 measure how you're doing is to look at the last, I don't know, whatever you can
66:23 remember, say the last week, go back in your memory and and remember what you did for the last week or if you only the
66:30 last day, that's all right, but remember it. And if during that day or week, keep
66:36 track of how many times you had negative feelings. When did you feel upset, hurt,
66:44 angry, abused, misunderstood? Well, not just misunderstood, but but um
66:50 misunderstood in kind of a negative way, stress, all of those things. Certainly anger,
67:00 upset at other people, and think how many times did I have negative feelings?
67:08 Most people only have to go back about two hours to find a negative feeling. Most people have negative feelings all
67:16 the time. Just the news makes them angry. You know, everything kind of makes them angry. People that disagree
67:22 with them makes them angry. But if you grow up, that's not the case. You can
67:27 say, "Well, I haven't had any negative feelings for as long back as I can see." Well, now you're doing really, really
67:32 well. You are a low entropy person. If you're the average person, you have negative feelings off and on regularly.
67:41 If as you grow up, it's less and less. So, that's how you can tell about how you're doing. Just the negative
67:47 feelings. Annoyed, upset, shouldn't be that way. those people,
67:55 they're they're screwing it all up for the rest of us. You know, this kind of of of
68:02 attitude and we tend to blame everybody else for the things that we don't like.
68:10 George made me angry. George doesn't make you angry. You choose to be angry.
68:16 You have some sort of fear and George just resonated with that fear of yours and you get angry.
68:23 So nobody makes you angry, nobody makes you upset, nobody makes you have negative feelings. All that comes out of
68:31 yourself. So when you get rid of the fear, you get rid of the ego, you get
68:36 rid of the beliefs. Beliefs are traps. You get rid of the beliefs,
68:42 you're a happy camper. You enjoy your life. You smile a lot. You laugh. You
68:48 play. And you're very productive. You get a lot done and anything you need or
68:55 want falls at your feet just as you need and want it. Life just you seem to be
69:01 very lucky. But you're not lucky. You're just leveling up in a game that's all
69:07 about, you know, lowering your entropy, becoming becoming love. So that's how
69:12 you know if you look at your life and say, "Well, my life is just a series of struggles. I thought if I just get past
69:18 this, if this relationship just worked out if this my boss just gave me this raise, everything would be good after
69:25 that. And it may be good for a few weeks after that or maybe even a few months. But you always end up back in that same
69:32 spot with this hurdle that you have to get by or have to get over. If I could just get over this and if that were
69:38 true, everything would be downhill after that. And it doesn't work that way. The
69:44 only way everything is downhill after that is if you grow up and and uh start
69:52 caring and sharing and cooperating, having compassion,
69:57 you help people. You stop asking what's in it for me and instead you ask how can
70:02 I help? Then your life gets to be good and happy. to bring this down to
70:10 the immediately practical for people. Um, if one wants to begin exploring in
70:16 any program to develop one's own consciousness, I've heard you
70:22 speak to how it must therefore start by getting acquainted and spending time
70:27 exploring your own consciousness. So for those that want to deepen on that path of exploration,
70:33 um, is meditation the place that you you advise most people to start? Well, meditation is the kind of the the given
70:43 answer to that question. Yes, you everybody starts with meditation. But
70:48 it's not the only path. There are two paths. And meditation has been the path
70:54 of choice for centuries, if not millennia. Get acquainted with your own
71:00 mind. Quiet your mind. Learn to be able to sit for as long as you want to. An hour, two hours with this. No thoughts.
71:07 Just be with your own mind. When you get into that space,
71:12 you let the world go. You're no longer your senses are no longer processing
71:18 sense data. So you're really not here anymore because processing sense data is what here, you know, what defines here.
71:25 So you're not really here anymore. And where are you? You're just, you know, it's the daycare moments. You you just,
71:31 you know, I think, therefore they am. You know, I'm conscious. I'm aware. Therefore I am.
71:36 And when you get there, all you need from that point is an intention to do
71:41 whatever it is you want to do. Now you are a mind in the consciousness system and you are able to explore that system,
71:48 gather data from that system, um, meet others out there in the non-physical,
71:56 talk to dead people, whatever you want. You know, that's available to you. But
72:02 it's not just as easy as learning to meditate and there it is. You know, it
72:08 takes time to develop that intuitive side and it takes understanding.
72:14 So, it's not a quick thing. But I had a lot of students who had trouble with
72:21 meditation and some of them it wasn't anything attitudinal. It was just there
72:27 like ADD. sitting still and having a quiet mind is pretty much impossible
72:32 when you have a central nervous system that's jumping here and jumping there and they will just let everything go and
72:38 they can't do that. And I also had a lot of very leftrain logic process types who
72:45 just couldn't let go of that control that anything that would happen on the
72:50 intuitive side that logical side would come in and crash it. wanted to analyze it or judge it right away, which would
72:57 kill it, of course, because now you're in that that logical side and the logical side and the intuitive side
73:04 don't work together. Now, you can teach them to work together, but most people
73:10 they don't. You can learn to be extremely rightrained, extremely intuitive, and
73:17 extremely logical both. You can be extreme in both cases, but that's only
73:23 after a lot of years of practice do you get there. But there is another way for people who have trouble meditating,
73:29 whether it's an overactive intellect or whether it's just some central nervous system twitch that they can't let go of.
73:37 And that is through your imagination. It's a alternate path.
73:43 And once I realized that, I wanted to write make tools for those people
73:49 because that whole bunch of to people who had been hanging out in my circles
73:54 for years and they still never had that out of body, was never successful at the paranormal things. So I developed this
74:01 thing I call Tom's Park which uses imagination to get to the same place.
74:08 And the way you use that is you have to imagine something with enough
74:15 information to basically consume your mind. So you imagine where you are.
74:21 You're walking at a beach, but you're not just at a beach. You hear the surf. You see the surf going in and out. You
74:28 hear the birds, you know, you hear you feel the sand between. You can smell the
74:33 saltwater. So you you smelled, you taste, you hear, you see, you know, you
74:39 touch. All of those things have to be going in detail. And if you can get practice, takes practice to get that and
74:46 you you get that detail going, then start off on a story. What do you find on that beach? You know, who else do you
74:52 run into? And eventually you stop playing the parts of all the characters
74:57 like you do in a daydream. And the thing just takes on a life of its own. the
75:02 people you meet, the things they say are not things that are even in your mind. And the story goes, what happens is the
75:08 larger conscious system takes that story you've made and just continues it and
75:14 then takes you into a space where you've got something to learn. So it's another way to get out of body, if you will, to
75:21 get into the non-physical space. You can do it through your imagination
75:27 and meditation. usually is a beginner's tool. I know
75:34 that's heresy to a lot of meditators, but it's it's mostly a beginner's tool.
75:40 After you learn well enough, you can do that meditation in seconds. You don't have to sit down and quiet your mind and
75:47 say your mantra and do all kind of stuff. You just you're there. So, you
75:53 kind of stop the process and get there very quickly eventually. And from my own
75:59 experience, I'd say that, you know, how often do you meditate? They asked me and said, 'Well, I really don't meditate anymore. On the other hand, an
76:06 equivalent answer is I meditate all the time. I'm always in a meditation state.
76:11 So, they're both true, equally true. You can just see it from from either side. I'm constant meditation state. And to
76:20 let the sense data go, I can do that in in fractions of a second. So it's just a
76:25 matter of you get so familiar with that intuitive state in that space that you
76:30 can just go there very easily and life becomes
76:39 different in the sense that now you have a much bigger decision space.
76:44 Most people have a decision space that combines of their memory and the stuff they get from their senses that it's
76:51 interacting. So there's certain choices they have based on that. Once you live
76:56 equally in an intuitive space or equally able to get around an intuitive space and an intellectual space,
77:04 you find that you spend most of your time in the intuitive space because that's a richer has more information in
77:11 it. It's a richer space than the physical space. So you live say 75
77:17 depends on the situation 75 sometimes 80 90 sometimes only 50 sometimes 40 but
77:23 most of the time you exist in a state that is more intuitive than it is
77:28 logical and then you can pop into the logical state whenever you need to. And I have
77:36 found that the two sides that seem to be incompatible, that intuitive state and that logical state, intellectual state
77:45 actually become good friends and work well with each other. And the intuitive side will get some information, pass it
77:51 over to the intellectual side to do some assessment on it, you know, do some analysis on it. And then that that uh
77:59 that side that's intellectual will pass over stuff because it needs more information. it doesn't have enough
78:04 information to do a logical problem and then the intuitive side goes up and gets the information passes it over to the
78:10 intellectual side. So then you become not leftrain or rightrain but whole and
78:15 all of that works together and you just live in a larger reality than most people. You have a bigger the size your
78:22 reality is measured by the size of your decision space. So now you meet somebody
78:27 and you know some things about them right away. Within 10 or 20 seconds, you
78:34 got a sense of that person and who they are and what they are and what's inside and why they do what they do and all the
78:39 rest of it, which makes it easier for you to be useful and to be helpful with those people. So you live in a space
78:46 that is intuitive, but you're also rational and logical at the same time.
78:53 So that's really where you're going to, you know, if you're looking for endstates, you know, that's really where
78:59 you're going to to that sort of a thing. But that takes a long time to do that
79:05 and it takes a lot of effort because there you have three sources of
79:11 information that come to you. One's the larger conscious system sends you a data stream. Any all consciousness is netted.
79:18 So, you can communicate with any other consciousness, including your dogs and your cats and your horse and and the
79:23 bumblebees. You can communicate with anything that's conscious, and consciousness can send messages back and
79:30 forth that way. Telepathy is a real thing. Yeah, we just had Kai Dickens with the telepathy tapes on here last week. The
79:37 timing of this conversation's right. Well, the reason that those uh autistic children seem to be good at that is
79:44 because their intellectual side was damaged. their intellectual side doesn't work. So if you've got these two sides,
79:50 an intellectual side and two side, intellectual side doesn't work, what do you do? You start developing your
79:56 intuitive side. And can you hear what your mother's thinking? Of course you can. Consciousnesses are all netted. Of
80:03 course you can hear that. So that's the first. You said there's three. Yes, that's the first is the larger
80:09 conscious system. The second is conscious to consciousness. Somebody can be sending you a message. Somebody can
80:15 be putting thoughts into your into your mind. Okay. Yes. Oh, thoughts into your mind. Yeah, we can talk about that
80:21 later. But they can give you ideas and feelings and suggestions and things. And
80:26 the third is that you're a piece of conscious and you can create virtual realities yourself. You can create
80:34 information. So those three things, it's yourself, it's somebody else with consciousness or some other thing with
80:41 the consciousness or it's a larger conscious system. And unfortunately, those three streams don't come with
80:46 tags. You never know where it's coming from. So you you have to be skeptical of
80:53 everything. Now, even with experience, you'll never know precisely where it's
80:59 coming from. But with experience, you'll you'll get, "Well, that's an 80. That's a 90. Oh, that's a 99.99. That's I'm
81:05 real familiar with that one." And you know, so you get to where you can label those and you get even familiar with the
81:11 stuff that you create yourself. But one has to always be skeptical. You never
81:17 know the source of what you get and you never know exactly why you're getting
81:23 it. Okay? It's a it's something you get from the larger kind of system, something you've asked for. But is that
81:30 really because that's true or you're getting this because that's information you need to know to grow and to learn.
81:37 So you can't say, "Oh, there's a fact." You can just say, "Oh, there's something. I wonder what that means and
81:44 how it's going to affect me." So the the question is not, "Is that real?" The
81:49 question is, "Is that helpful?" So you get information from lots of sources.
81:54 And this idea about reality is just a bad idea. Information is real. That's
82:02 the only consciousness is real. Conscious information system. So information is real. And that's the only
82:08 thing that's real. Everything else is a virtual reality. When you die, you end up in another virtual reality. When you
82:14 dream, you're in another virtual reality. When you daydream, you're in another virtual reality. The daydreams,
82:20 you start by creating them yourself. you know, the out of body is another virtual reality.
82:25 Yeah, I think it's important to to think about how these are useful terms, but
82:31 also they fall short in many ways. You know, it's helpful to conceptualize reality as a virtual system or a
82:37 or as a computer um that's being rendered. Um, and I think for some people throughout
82:44 culture could maybe refer back to the movie The Matrix. And there's a lot of overlap here. You kind of remind me of
82:49 The Architect. I don't know. probably heard that before. I've heard that before. Yeah. But, you know, when the oracle especially is
82:55 talking with Neo and and the reason we're here to is to understand the the why behind the decisions that we're
83:01 making um and how information that's coming through these three different streams
83:07 uh are ultimately we're here to learn the the the reason of if something
83:14 inherently doesn't appear to be reducing entropy in a in a given decision. we will then learn why that was the case
83:20 and then and go on to evolve from from that decision. You're absolutely right. All of those
83:26 things that's why I started off saying these are just metaphors. Larger conscious system is a metaphor for source. I OC individual cons just a
83:34 metaphor for that function that has to happen. So I went through the the logical steps that had to be in this
83:41 model. I gave them names but it's just a model. It's a way of thinking about it.
83:47 It's a way that helps you put what structure to reality and that's
83:55 all it is. You know, it's it's no more than a a way of looking at things that
84:01 makes better sense. And yeah, I get people get hung up on on, you know, well, what does that do?
84:10 You know, when it's got free will awareness unit out there, what is it doing? He's just sitting right as it communicating. And I said, "Yeah, you
84:15 you're pushing the metaphor too far. It's just there for a function of the accumulator for the experiences that the
84:23 free will units have. That's all. That's its function. Don't add more to it. I
84:28 just have the functions of the essential functions of consciousness." And you
84:34 start to complicate it with asking questions that really aren't relevant.
84:39 Doesn't matter what it does all day. These are the these are the key ideas and these are just ways of sorting it.
84:47 Words that help people understand. I use the computer metaphors because they're more understandable today. You know, if
84:54 you use the metaphors that the Buddha used, well, that's goes back to poetry. You have to understand, you have to be
84:60 able to understand. You have to know what he knows in order to understand what he says, which is a chicken and egg
85:06 problem. So, anyhow, yeah, I just wanted to make that comment. This this is not these are the facts. There is this thing
85:13 out there and it has these piece parts. These are all it's a it's a way of looking at things that makes better
85:20 sense. That's all. Hey everyone, a quick one. You guys know how much I love Mudwater and have shared about their

86:24 I hope you enjoy. Back to the show. It's helpful to see the inherent limits
86:29 of our logic um and what it has the unique capacity to do because a lot of
86:35 us who again live in this culture where the intellect is premier source of intelligence we want and we crave that
86:42 that feeling of satiation to understand how things connect and I love that part of me I know you you strongly have that
86:48 part of you as well and but then again it gets to that point where it's important to surrender
86:54 knowing to uh to to the deeper intuitive source that is different and and beyond
86:59 what we can logically empirically deduce right starts from what I was saying
87:04 about we don't have the vocabulary yeah to describe abstract things we don't
87:10 have a vocabulary the words or even the thoughts to describe consciousness what is it where is it
87:17 well it's nowhere doesn't have any extent there isn't distance there well
87:23 how does it work how does it pass information around You're you're looking for details that really aren't important. You just have
87:30 to understand its function and how it works and let the rest go because what you're doing is trying to take that
87:36 abstraction and turn it into something concrete. And that's wrong. This virtual
87:41 reality is what we see as concrete and we want it to be like this virtual reality with piece parts that we can
87:46 assemble and take them apart and lay them out on a bench so we can see how all the details work. But it's not like
87:52 that at all. We're talking about a a thing that's alive and conscious and aware and it doesn't have an extent. It
88:01 doesn't have to pass data around. It just knows. Well, everything has to pass data around. Well, only if it has
88:07 extent. Extent doesn't have to be there. It's just consciousness. Stop trying to look
88:14 at all its piece parts and try to understand what it is and how you relate to it and it relates to you. That's
88:21 what's important. One of the key points that people have to understand as they're trying to wrap
88:26 their heads around this is that this isn't something that you can just get
88:33 intellectually. If it's not your experience, it can't be your truth. So, you may read about it
88:40 and you may think, "Oh, that sounds true and I can see how all that works." But if it's not your truth, if you haven't
88:46 experienced it, it's somebody else's truth. It's the truth of the guy that wrote the book, but it's not your truth.
88:51 You have to experience it and you have you are limited by your experience. If
88:57 you get things if data comes to you and it's outside of your experience, you don't know how to interpret it. Now, you
89:04 can make up a story about it and say, "Oh, well, it's like this and like this." But that's just the story you make up. And then you can believe the
89:10 story. And that's what most people do. They make up stories and then they believe them. But understanding that if
89:16 it's not your if it's not your experience, then
89:23 it's not going to help you grow up. It's the difference between acting kind and
89:29 being kind. You can read all about kindness and you can you can just be as kind as you can
89:36 be to everybody you see, but if it's all coming out of your intellect because that's the way you think you should be,
89:42 you don't gain. You're not leveling up. You have to be kind. Not that kind.
89:50 Yeah. It's it really takes a matured a matured person to
89:55 explore things and and receive information that is outside of your experience without accepting or
90:01 rejecting it, but taking it as a data point and experimenting with it and seeing if it's
90:07 valid and true. And then it can be your own theory of any everything and not just somebody on a podcast you heard
90:12 once. Exactly. I say that over and over in my book. you know that my big toe should
90:17 just be a starting point for your big toe. You know, if it's not your experience, it's not your truth. And the
90:23 only way to proceed is with an open mind and a very skeptical mind. Be skeptical
90:30 of everything and everybody. And the person you have to be most skeptical about is yourself because we are really
90:37 good at convincing ourselves that uh we are pretty wonderful and have all the right ideas. So u skepticism is a
90:46 absolutely necessary part of this path but it really helps crack at the our
90:52 notions of how solid and concrete our the this apparent universe is when
90:59 you explore and you differentiate PMR and NPMR physical matter reality and non-physical matter reality and you
91:07 start to walk people through of course there is a non-physical world the vast majority of The cosmos is made
91:14 up of empty space. Um, people are watching this conversation right now by
91:21 virtue of invisible frequencies that are enabling their device to be able to
91:26 download and play and watch wherever they are. And uh, and so it doesn't seem
91:32 like that big of a stretch to be exploring. And these other topics are on more paranormal
91:38 activities and remote viewing. And um I think it's been so fascinating to talk
91:45 with Kai last week um on the telepathy tapes and with you because it seems like right now there's a cultural shift in
91:51 our deepening of understanding what consciousness is and the repeatability of these different
91:56 studies um within individuals. And so, uh, what is the like gamut of these
92:02 non-physical experiences that you've had that, uh, invite reflections around the
92:07 afterlife, remote viewing, the paranormal? Just talk us talk us through a little bit of those experiences.
92:14 They are all related. They're not independent. They're all kind of related. And the active ingredient is
92:21 always intent. Though we can build up all sorts of tools that help us focus
92:26 that intent. A lot of those tools we tend to we tend
92:32 to invent tools, create tools and then we believe in them and they become they become not just tools but they become uh
92:40 you know solid things that are there. Uh
92:45 for instance things like chakras now I'm going to upset a whole lot of people but chakras are not fundamental. They're
92:51 tools that we create. It helps us understand. It breaks the it breaks the
92:56 things we want to understand down into the piece parts and by relating those
93:02 piece parts to the body it makes it more concrete not so abstract.
93:07 Uh when we you know and we need those tools to help explain you have to take
93:13 that abstraction put it into more concrete terms so that people can use their language and their experience to
93:21 understand what's what's going on. So they're essential. I think it's important to differentiate though what's
93:26 perceived as a tool versus what is uh a reality from the perspective of the
93:31 physical and that includes the more subtle realms of our energetic body and makeup and whatnot. And so um I just I
93:38 don't I don't fully understand your distinction there. Okay. Um
93:44 let's talk about healing. Okay. We we hear the word light light workers. Well,
93:49 that is people who have the metaphor that what is ill in a person, what is
93:55 wrong, you know, poor health is dark. And the darker it is, the worse it is.
94:00 So, if it's really black black, then it's maybe a a deadly cancerous tumor.
94:06 If it's just light gray, then maybe it's the flu. If it's just very a little bit
94:11 of gray, it's probably just an irritation or something. So they have that as a as a uh kind of an output for
94:18 format of the data that they get from getting into the database and getting
94:23 information about that person's health. Now they'll take a a bar of light, you know, in in Monroe's vocabulary, that's
94:30 the energy bar tool, but they will put that white energy on that till it burns that black away and that helps them
94:36 heal. Well, all of that is just tools. It doesn't exist. light doesn't really
94:43 exist. It's the mind. The intention of the mind
94:48 is what heals. But people need tools to
94:54 use that intention. If you just said, "Well, it's just your intent that does it. Okay, heal. You're done. You're
94:60 healed." Well, that wouldn't work. People wouldn't do that because they couldn't get the the oomph. They couldn't put the energy in that because
95:06 that's so unbelievable that that could possibly work. that people wouldn't feel like they were doing anything. People
95:13 have this sense out of being in this seemingly physical reality that you can't change something without doing
95:18 something. You can't just do it in your mind. You have to do something. So, you need your
95:24 energy bar tool to burn away the black stuff. And that's a tool. Now, a
95:29 teaching tool is like the the chakras. A teaching tool. We have a lot of teaching tools
95:36 that we use. It helps break things up into into uh parts, give those parts certain
95:43 attributes and it helps people understand in a more concrete way. Now, sure, I can look at you and I can see
95:50 chakras. Well, does that mean they're real? No, it's just information. I can
95:55 get the data with that output. You see, let's say um look at lead better man
96:04 invisible. He wrote a little book and he shows all of these auras around people and he tells you what it means. The yellow up around the head, that's
96:09 intelligence. And the purple there, that's spirituality. And that big red zigzaggy thing going around, that's
96:15 anger. Well, that's not real. That was his interpretation. And everybody reads
96:22 the book. So everybody sees about the same things because that becomes your output format for looking at auras. If
96:30 you want to, you can redefine that. And you can say, I want a blue zigzag line to be anger and I want red to be, I
96:40 don't know, something else. I want red to be health. And then when you get that data, you'll get it in the format that
96:46 you specify. And you can look at a chart and you can say, well, here's health and here's
96:51 time. I'd like to see this person's health from now till 10 years from now. And because there's a lot of probability
96:58 of the way it might go, I want to see uh uh three sigma error bars around around
97:04 that line of probable health. Well, you can get that. The system will give you anything you like. Even with statistical
97:11 analysis, you just have to specify what your format is that you want and it'll
97:17 give it to you in that format. So when you talk about subtle bodies and those things this you know even the outer body
97:25 right just the idea you're not inside your body you don't have a spirit that
97:30 lives in your body and comes out through your head and flies off that's not you're a piece of consciousness you're
97:36 already out of your body your body is an avatar and it doesn't have a heart or a brain or anything it's just I can't all
97:42 all that ever gets rendered is just what you can see everything inside doesn't
97:47 get rendered there doesn't have to render oxygen in this room. We just keep going as if
97:53 there were oxygen in the room. It's rendering our bodies. The only time you'll it'll render oxygen in the room
97:59 if you got a test for oxygen and then it'll render what you need for that test. If you cut somebody's head open,
98:04 it'll render a brain. And you cut the brain open, it'll render all the, you know, neurology in there. But otherwise,
98:12 it doesn't render any of that. So you don't have a spirit that lives in your
98:18 body. And if you do an out of body like I did, you know, I did out of bodies and
98:24 I thought the same thing. Well, I'm I'm going to come out of the body. I'm obviously going to be in my bedroom. I'm going to turn around and look at my
98:29 body. And that's exactly what I did. I turned around and there's my body laying in the bed. Sure enough. But then I
98:36 realized you don't have to do that. You can become out of body and you never sit your bedroom. It's it's not there. You
98:41 just you're just wherever it is you want to you want to be in whatever reality frame you want to be in and it's
98:47 instantaneous. There's no travel. There's no uh body. So your
98:53 consciousness the body is is just computed. It's not a real thing anymore.
98:58 And your elf is a real thing. Okay. So this idea that you have a body and then you have a subtle body and then you have
99:05 the spiritual body and all these things are concentric with each you get that. Well, that was a model back in the 1800s
99:12 when Madame Blasy and the theosophists were were uh turning over new ideas and
99:19 publishing them. And it came from this idea that the spirit lives inside the body. You know, that's why we put our
99:26 hand over our mouth when we yawn because you keep evil spirits from going into your mouth. That's where that comes
99:32 from. So we had those kinds of beliefs. Back in the day when Fox and Mold Dune
99:38 and and so on were writing their books about out of body. There was always cords. A silver cord was attached. And
99:45 if you cut that cord ah the body would die because it would lose its spirit and
99:50 the spirit would die because it got connected from its body and they'd fall over dead. And that isn't the case. When
99:57 I when Bob Monroe did all this auto, he didn't have any silver cord. That was a belief. So we make up a story that
100:04 explains what we've experienced. So they've they had a belief about being
100:09 tethered to the body. So they got a silver cord that represented that belief. Remember, you interpret the data
100:16 and you interpret it based on what you know and what you believe and what your fears are. So these things don't
100:24 actually exist. You don't have an athereic body and a what else? Whatever. You know, here's your emotional body.
100:31 Now, sure, I see those things. If I want to look at your emotional body, I can just call up and say, you know, what's
100:37 his emotional information look like? And there it is. And I can make a I can make it whatever colors I want. As long as
100:44 I'm consistent, it'll do that. So those that data is there, but that you
100:50 interpret it as a egg of light around a human being, that's a belief.
100:57 You can look at a picture, a photograph of somebody and you can look at their emotional body too and all the rest of
101:04 their auras. You can look at a spiritual body and a health body and all those things are just information that you get
101:10 because you have an intention to get them and you have some kind of intention of the format you want them in. And it
101:16 may be just what everybody else sees or you may make up your own. So that's that's what I'm saying. There is no real
101:23 athereic body and subtle body and well I completely hear you. I think the distinction between what is absolute
101:30 reality and relative reality is important. These ideas of like the inner sciences precede far beyond blobotssky or you
101:36 know beliefs around what like there is a rule set. There is there is
101:42 there is a distinction between what is real and what is true. From the from the perspective of the absolute there is
101:47 only consciousness. Uh but from the from the perspective of the relative human
101:53 experience, we do have these more subtle aspects of ourselves. Like you said, you could tune in to you can perceive these
101:58 things. Sure. Um but where I think it gets a little bit tricky in articulating this stuff is
102:04 sometimes it comes across as if this is all like everything that we
102:10 perceive is an illusion. And from from an aspect it is, but it is also the illusion that consciousness is playing
102:15 for the purpose of lowering entropy and evolving and all of these things. And so I'm just curious where do you see this
102:22 perspective going too far and how it bypasses the game that we're here to
102:27 play essentially and the human experience? Um because it can it can quickly go into the dangerous territory
102:33 of completely denying our own humanity when we are here to have a human experience.
102:38 Yeah. No, I don't. I think it it elucidates all of that. It makes the
102:44 human experience more valuable. Uh it uh helps you understand.
102:50 The thing is that people have experiences and
102:55 the first thing they have to take that experience and they they they u get the data. They get a data stream.
103:03 That's an experience. They interpret that data and that interpretation is in terms of their beliefs.
103:09 So if you see if you think there has to be a connection between the body and spirit then you'll see a silver cord or
103:14 some other kind of connection because that's part of your belief. So you will see the data that way you'll introduce
103:21 that. So by understanding that
103:28 people really have no other choice but to take their experience and describe it in the best terms they can. Okay? To
103:35 make it rational so they can talk about it. so they can interact with it. So we do that. We say, well, you have this
103:42 body and then there's the subtle aeric body outside of that and then there's the, you know, the body with the
103:48 emotions outside of that and you have the auras and the colors and all these things. Well, that's a that's a
103:54 metaphor. It's a metaphor for the information. You're getting information
104:00 about that health body, that athetheric body. You gain all the information about that and you see it in terms of light
104:09 around a person and it's easy enough to see that way. So you do and you make up
104:15 a model. You make up an explanation, something that makes it fit more
104:20 concrete, a way you can explain it, the way you can show it, the way you can tell it to other people. Otherwise,
104:26 everybody'd be saying, "Well, I experienced something, but I don't know what it is." You know, that's not helpful. So it's necessary that we use
104:33 these tools. We make up tools but we have to understand they're not fundamental. They're just helpful tools
104:40 that helps us understand our experience because otherwise you get you can get
104:47 trapped by knowing you know by thinking this tool this is the truth. Now
104:52 somebody else, okay, you go to uh the Tibetan Buddhists and they don't have
104:59 chakras. You go to the, you know, aboriges in Australia and they don't have chakras.
105:05 What's the matter? They're not as good as the as the Buddhists. They don't see things as well. No, the chakra is just
105:12 something that is a is a tool that we help explain things. Otherwise, we say, "Oh, well, they're wrong because they
105:19 don't have this." And pretty soon it's a right and wrong rather than they have
105:24 different tools. They see things in a different way. It's not that they're wrong and you're right because you see,
105:31 you know, auras. It's an aura is a way that you are interpreting the data. It
105:38 you can interpret in terms of light and that's a good way and you can see the
105:43 chakras and you can interpret that in terms of these things and how they affect your life and you can learn from
105:49 them. You can grow from them. The tool, I'm not saying these tools are irrelevant. They're not. They're very
105:54 important. We have experiences. We make up a story, the best story we can think
105:60 of, and then we tend to believe it. And that story
106:06 then becomes fact when really it's just a good story that helps people understand what's going on. So, you
106:13 don't you're not going to go into uh some kind of negative space with that. In fact, it just opens things up. So
106:20 when the when the Zen Buddhists don't see chakras, it's not a matter of judgment of they just haven't gotten
106:27 there yet. You know, Buddha's way ahead of them. You know, it's that that's not tools they use. They have their own
106:33 tools. They have a totally different tool set to get there. And
106:39 that's why you can look at all of the various practices, all of the various
106:46 interpretations, and you can understand all of them and see the value in all of them.
106:52 Hey guys, a bit of a different share. For those that don't know, music has always been a big part of my life. What
106:58 started with picking up a guitar when I was eight has evolved over time into a deep love for exploring the power of
107:05 sound, getting into recording more music myself, and discovering various instruments that feel like portals into
107:11 another world. There are some instruments that resonate in such a way that are conducive to meditative states
107:17 both in listening and playing. One of which I found is the hand pan, which if you don't know, this flying saucer UFO
107:25 looking thing is made of sheet steel which is derived of iron. And by forging
107:30 these little dimples and domes throughout, you can build out musical scales which are amazing to play.
107:38 This one in specific and eara is by this company based out of the Netherlands
107:44 called Aasa. When I first found out about them, I was playing with Malt
107:49 Martin who came over. We were hanging out. He's an incredible musician if you haven't heard his stuff, and he recommended Ayasa as the place to get
107:56 the highest quality instruments. So, thankfully, when I reached out, they were excited to collaborate, and that's
108:02 exactly what this is. For anyone interested in exploring the world of hand pans from a company with integrity
108:09 that ships to customers all over the world, I highly recommend them. And you can check them out atasainstruments.com.
108:16 The link in description as always. Back to the show.
108:21 What does your theory say about what the Eastern contemplative practices would describe in their use of the story of
108:29 mukti enlightenment, the dissolution of the self when one realizes and wakes up to the most fundamental aspect in nature
108:35 of themsel? Uh from the lens of the language that you use uh what is that
108:41 moment? How do you describe that? Oh, it's a moment that everyone can have. It takes a while, I guess, to get there.
108:48 But the way I describe that is you become one with a larger conscious system. You see reality through its
108:55 eyes. You see it as it sees it. And when you make that connection that
109:02 when you when you get there, then you lose your own identity. You're no longer
109:09 Tom. You're no longer even a human being or experience thing. You just are a part
109:15 of everything. You're a piece of every blade of grass and every leaf on every tree. You are all of it. And you have no
109:24 sense of self whatsoever. You're not independent. You're just a piece of all
109:29 that is. You're a piece of reality. And you feel that as a field of love,
109:36 compassion, connection. It's not that you're just seeing all this stuff. You're a piece of it. You're all and
109:43 there's nothing in your feeling space other than love. Okay? So, you have that
109:49 experience and that's what samadei or whatever when you see these guys and they're like this and they got a big
109:55 grin on their face because they're in bliss. Uh that's what they are. They're
110:00 in that space and that's a space that you can learn to go to and really kind
110:06 of whenever you want. But to me, I hate to use the word, but it's like a
110:11 sacred space that I wouldn't abuse. I wouldn't go there every day. It's it's
110:19 that would almost trivialize it to where it wouldn't be such a big deal. It is an immense big deal. It'll change your
110:25 life. A lot of the people that have near-death experiences, they get that experience. They're given that
110:30 experience. It's given to them and changes their life entirely. they suddenly see the larger picture and it's
110:38 not at all what they thought. So that is a very real experience. It's
110:45 it's um really not all that hard to attain. You don't have to meditate for
110:51 dozens of years. I had a lot of the students that are first time they don't know much about meditation at all, but
110:57 they can get there if you give them a little idea about how and the path and what it is. So it's not an impossible
111:04 thing that yogis who are yogis for, you know, 50 years, you know, can attain this and you can't. You can. You just
111:11 have to be able to let go of the physical. You have to be able to not
111:17 have the fear, not have the ego and not have the beliefs so that you can just open your mind to being. And if you can
111:24 get in that state, then you can get there. It is blissful.
111:30 and you don't want to come back. You're there and it's just awesome, but you
111:36 know it's time to come back or you'll be put back if you don't know that and then you let it go. And times that you're
111:44 feeling particularly out of energy or whatever is a good time
111:49 to go do that because it it will renew you. It will make you smile even if
111:55 everything's falling apart in your life. It'll it'll be a a moment of bliss and happiness and contentment and you feel
112:01 like you're one with everybody and everything. So that's a real that's a real experience and it's an experience
112:09 that I would wish everybody would have because it changes you when you have that experience. But you are basically
112:18 one with the larger consciousness system if you will. Now you're at the source.
112:23 That's that's the way source sees things. It is everything. We are all
112:29 one. Even the blades of grass all come from the same source. It's all created
112:34 in consciousness. In many ways, it could be seen that the most important thing that happens to us
112:40 is to experience and taste that reality firsthand because it transforms us on
112:45 contact. And I'm curious because I've heard you elaborate on sort of your key discoveries doing this work for over a
112:52 few few decades. Um, one of which was let understanding and value flow to you
112:59 as a result of fixing yourself. If you chase it with your intellect, you are unlikely to find it. Mhm.
113:04 And so it is also I mean seen through many ways the dowist lens of by creating space
113:13 between us and that which we identify. We get to hang out with the larger consciousness system and therefore uh
113:20 there is less force and control over reality. And like you spoke to, what is needed in our in our life appears for us
113:28 and we're at flow with uh what this life is is is meant to be. And so I'm just
113:35 curious for you to speak to that a little bit in your experience of of of how that feels like and and what becomes
113:41 available to you as you start to actually get into that flow. Well,
113:47 I've been working at this since I don't know. I guess
113:54 well, I was working at it when I was six and seven years old. You know, I started my adventures then and then I let go of
114:02 it and came back to it in the middle 20s and I've been engaged in discovery ever
114:09 since. You never stop discovering. discovery is is what you do. It's not
114:15 that, oh, I I know all this stuff now. I'm done. You know, you're never done. There's always more things to learn. But
114:22 I was somewhere in my late 20s or early 30s when I realized
114:28 that trying hard to make things come out the way I wanted was always making them
114:35 come out less than optimal because I didn't really understand all the
114:40 connections and all the things that were going on and all the wise of all of the things that it was really above my my uh
114:50 awareness a a lot of things that were happening and the reasons that they were happening. So when I try to order it, oh
114:55 this is the way things should be and it didn't turn out the beautiful story that I had expected it to turn out and then I
115:03 realized that if you don't try to make it come out into a beautiful story,
115:08 it'll come out into a story that's more beautiful than you could have imagined if you just let it be and don't try to
115:16 manipulate it or control it. And that was like a wow that's very you know
115:22 interesting. I mean I'm a I'm a physicist you know I I take all my knowledge and and I play with it I see
115:29 if it's real I test it but then it becomes fact for me and that was a big
115:35 step in this process where I realized that stop trying to make the world
115:41 according to you you know your vision of what it should be. let the world be and
115:47 it will self-optimize without you meddling with it. And if you meddle with it, all you're doing is
115:52 getting in the way of that self-optimization and it just screws things up. So at that
115:58 point I was had a big change in my life that I stopped being the smart guy that
116:03 knew all the right answers and knew what people should be doing and thinking and I became a lot more humble at the idea
116:11 that let them think and do whatever comes to them and I just deal with it in a positive way and that will optimize
116:18 things for everybody. So that was a big lesson and that was probably late 20s early 30s that I got there. So my
116:24 lessons came in bits and pieces over I I'm 80 years old now. So I've been
116:32 doing this for since I was in the middle 20s. Okay. So I got a lot of hours
116:38 logged. I got a lot of time. And during that time I probably spent close to 20
116:44 hours a week working with it. Not just an occasional thing that you know I meditated every once in a while for a
116:50 few years. I worked on it. I want to understand it. That's how I'm made.
116:55 That's why I'm a physicist. I want to understand things and I don't want to
117:01 just create beliefs because that seems like a good answer. I need to really
117:07 test it and see if that's the way it is. So, you start off with the idea that you
117:14 don't know anything. You throw it all away. you know, you get rid of all your beliefs, but you don't
117:20 really know anything. And that the the world, the existence is a
117:27 it's something to experience. And as you experience it, it will you
117:33 will see connections. You will see what affects what and eventually you will
117:39 test it. And then you'll, you know, that then becomes a fact for you. It's something that you've done. So I started
117:46 with with things like that, understanding that you have to just let life be. You have to let people be. You
117:52 know, people get upset and they say, "Oh, there's terrible people. They're awful. You know, they're ruining life." And you know, we need to change. It's
118:00 not we need to change. They need to change. It's the way people look at it. And they get upset at other people.
118:07 And that's just counterproductive. That isn't going to help. Lecturing somebody about why they're wrong is
118:14 never going to help them to see how to be right. Because whenever you push on people, they push back. All you do is
118:21 encourage them to go deeper into the dysfunction that they have. So you need to just let people be and realize that
118:27 everybody is doing the best they can with what they've got. And what they've got is fear and beliefs and a lack of
118:35 understanding and a lack of experience, but they're doing the best they can with it. So you have to let them be and give
118:42 them a space where they can stretch out beyond their comfort zone. Give them a
118:48 space that they can grow into which basically means you just be kind and nice to them and not be uh dogmatic and
118:55 not be quarrelome and just let them be who they are and you know love them,
119:01 care for them, be connected with them, try to be helpful to them even if they have ideas that are opposite to yours.
119:07 that will then give them space to grow. Lecturing them and telling them how they're wrong makes them even worse. So
119:14 you kind of get this idea that you're in this world to experience to connect to
119:21 understand and that you in the in a process of understanding you say well
119:26 here's the best model I can come up with all right now good use that model test
119:32 that model but realize it's a model realize that that's not necessarily a
119:38 fact now it may be a fact one day but you don't know that yet so you always have to be skeptical of yourself, of
119:46 what you know and what it means. So I when I was making my model, the
119:52 underlying thing here was to not put anything in it that wasn't absolutely
119:59 logically necessary for the whole model to work. So when I get asked the question, well, what does the IOC do all
120:06 day while the fair, you know, free will awareness unit is at work? It's not an important question.
120:11 I don't you know it's not like it has to be doing something doesn't it? No it
120:17 doesn't. It's just a function of consciousness. So we understand the function. We don't make things up. Well
120:24 let's see what could it be doing? Well it could be doing this and that. Well that's me making things up about what it
120:29 could be doing. I don't see an important function that it has to do for the whole system to be a good logical system. And
120:37 if I don't see that it has to do something then I leave it alone. I could dream up 10 things that it could be
120:43 doing, but I don't put those in my model. I only put the things in there that are essential for the logical flow
120:50 to go through. And I don't say that this model is the only model. There's lots of
120:56 models out there. Models are things that help people understand things. Come up with your own toe. That's better than
121:04 just doing mine. You know, mine is my conclusions, my truth, my experience.
121:10 And it can't be your truth and your experience. You need to come up with your own thing. So that people come up with their models. Okay, I go out of
121:16 body. I'm a spirit and I live inside the body and I come up out of my head and I need to stay attached to the body. So I
121:22 need a silver cord. All right. There's nothing wrong with that. I don't say, you know, that's wrong. It's just the
121:28 way they interpret their information. Your interpretation has to be based on
121:34 your experience, your beliefs, and your ego. You can't get away from that. That's you. It's who you are. But don't
121:41 make it fact, just make it my model. Okay? So that's kind of the way I see
121:48 things. So yes, I would say, you know, things like chakras, thousands of people use them. It's a very good tool. It's a
121:54 good way to break out the information. It's a good learning tool, but it doesn't make it fundamental.
122:00 What would you say? I'm curious. in the past few years. Is there another pre uh
122:06 is there another uh dominant key discovery that you've stumbled upon
122:11 whether it's in your theory, whether it's just through living life. Um what's what's an insight that has transformed
122:18 your life most that we haven't discussed yet? I think the insight that affects everybody's life is the realization of
122:25 uh of you know what is real, what is reality and what is our part in it. In
122:32 other words, what's your, you know, what are you doing here? What are you, what are you here for? What's the point of
122:39 your existence? And when you understand that, if that's an important thing for you to know, then
122:46 your picture will get bigger and bigger as you hone in on that. Now, different people will come to different metaphors.
122:52 They'll describe that in different ways. That's fine. You don't have to use my metaphors. My metaphors are really great
122:58 for people in computer science because they they get the metaphors and what they mean. For people that are not in
123:05 to, you know, modern computer terms, they find it kind of prickly and cold
123:10 because it's what do you mean it's an information system? Oh, that's cold and prickly because that's, you know, they
123:18 don't see that in warm tones. I see that as a good logical model and I don't need
123:24 to have the, you know, kind of the feel-good thing about it. It makes sense to me. So other models are good. Have
123:33 your own big toe. But the things that I learned was that you know it makes sense
123:39 to me that we evolve. Consciousness evolves by learning it entropy. Blowing entropy is love. Our whole purpose is to
123:47 grow to not be loving but to become love. Love
123:52 is the it's it's the uh what it's the the
123:59 attitude the mind. It's the existence of a low entropy consciousness. That's what defines love. A low entropy
124:05 consciousness because there's no ego, there's no beliefs. There's just love
124:11 and caring. And that's where we're headed. And
124:17 when you understand that, it gives you a much bigger picture. And you understand that that what is your reality
124:26 is just your interpretation of the data you get. Everybody has their own
124:31 reality. And their reality is as real for them as your reality is for you. And
124:37 you need to have respect for that reality that they have, whatever form it
124:43 takes. So you don't judge others. You don't judge, oh, they're they're using the wrong tools. There are no right or
124:49 wrong tools. The right tools are the tools that work for you. Those are the those are the right tools. And you'll
124:56 find as you grow up and understand more, your tools change. You let go of these tools cuz they're not really useful that
125:02 much anymore. And you pick new tools. And you get your tools to be more and more effective and more and more, what
125:10 can we say, efficient. You know, a lot of tools have a lot of process to them. First, you got to light the incense, and
125:16 then you have to put it next to the statue of Buddha, and then you got to play some nice serene music, and then
125:21 you got to sit down and cross your legs on a pillow. Then you, you know, they have all this this ritual basically that
125:27 they go through. And they can't meditate if they don't go through the ritual. That's part of their meditation process.
125:33 Well, that's tool. It works. It works for them. They should use that. It works for them. But eventually you get to
125:41 where the meditation's easier and easier and you don't need that sort of thing and then you make it more efficient and
125:46 more efficient and eventually you get to the point that you don't need any tools at all. You just you're there. So that's
125:53 tools are good and as we get things and we get an understanding we think well
125:59 how can I talk about this? How can I think about it? You have to put some kind of wrapper around it that allows
126:05 your language to talk about it. So you make up a story that makes sense to you
126:11 about this. And the problem is not that you make up a story. The problem is that
126:17 you believe that the story has a fact because then that limits you. Now the people that don't see it your way are
126:24 wrong. Whereas otherwise they're not wrong. They're just different.
126:31 You spoke, you hinted at this notion of where we are going as individ
126:36 individuated units of consciousness moving towards love. When you zoom out and look at humanity on this planet as a
126:43 whole and what seems to be this acceleration of change and access to information, what do you see in the next
126:50 5 to 10 years in terms of uh what is being birthed and revealed through
126:56 humanity at large? That's a really good question. Um,
127:01 you know, humans have been, well, let's put it this way. Homo sapiens been walking around on this planet for around
127:07 200,000 years. That's not a long time in the history of the universe, but for
127:12 about 200,000 years, Homo sapiens have been here. You know, plus or minus 50,000 years. You know, all that's
127:18 guesswork. So, don't take that too literally. And the point of coming here and and
127:25 logging on to a human is just so that you get uh meaningful choices that you get to make that are choices between
127:31 love and fear. So you come here and do that. And if you look at the growth that
127:36 we've had growth by that I mean spiritual growth, growth in becoming love um and letting go of fear, you'll
127:44 see that you know out of that 200,000 years you got probably about 190,000 of it where there wasn't much change. So if
127:51 this is the is the change, this is this is how much we get toward love on this axis and this is time then it's just
127:60 been kind of low. This is not a graduate school or high school or anything. This is daycare daycare for budding uh
128:08 individuated units of conscious and it's been low and it's just been like this but not much change. Well, now you go to
128:15 about I don't know a thousand years ago and you see there were some upticks. There were some things that were created
128:20 like republics where people got together and made choices together and and had
128:26 looked out for each other, but they also fighted fight with their neighbors and other things. So you see it ticks up a
128:32 little bit. You look 500 years ago, look at the way the world was 500 years ago. Life was cheap. People in charge could
128:38 just take somebody who was on the bottom and kill them just for fun if they wanted to. And there was no no problem with that.
128:45 And now the last 500 years. Oh, we've gone up in just 500 years. We've done
128:51 more growth than we did in that 190,000 years. Well, that's because the more you
128:58 learn, the easier it is to learn more. Learning accelerates. So, you learn and you get to this point
129:04 where it starts to go up. That's what it does. It goes very, very slow, but it
129:10 accelerates. And you slowly accelerate. and you get to the knee of the curve and then it goes really fast. We are right
129:16 here on that knee to the curve where it's starting to do this. That's called the knee of the curve in in math where
129:21 before it really shoots up, but it's just starting to to ramp up. Seriously,
129:26 that's where we are now. We're on that knee of the curve. For the first time in the human in the human history, we have
129:35 the possibility of taking some big steps spiritually that we've never been able
129:42 to do before. Before, let's say in the time of Buddha, you know, you could get up on a soap box and maybe 50 or 60
129:49 people could hear you if you had a loud voice and that was it. Well, that spreads very slowly and uh all the
129:57 religions always end up in the margins. They're not mainstream and where they're
130:03 when where they have been mainstream in history, they've usually also been kind of abusive. They this is what everybody
130:10 must do or else. So
130:17 yes, we're gaining we're in that point and the technology has is speeding up.
130:24 Change is speeding up. And whenever you have change that happens quickly, you
130:30 have turmoil. You have dysfunction. It causes a lot of of problems and some
130:38 people will suffer and and have problems because of it. But it takes that if you have change over a long period of time,
130:45 it's usually smooth, easy. Look at the industrial revolution. We started that
130:50 and it was abusive. You know, we'd go to China and grab people and throw them in boats to come over and work on the railroads. You know, we'd chain children
130:58 to their machine to make sure they would come back in the morning. Uh we did all kinds of abusive things, but eventually
131:04 we got over all that and all that was illegal and couldn't be done anymore. So, it got better and better and better
131:11 over time. But there was this took about 150 years, industrial revolutions, you know, about 150 years ago. And there's a
131:19 lot of lessons we didn't learn. We did learn not to chain children to machines and not the Shanghai, you know, people
131:25 to work on the railroads, but we didn't learn to love. We didn't learn to care because we are a materialist culture.
131:33 Materialism comes with an ethic. It's embedded in materialism. If you're a materialist, then the ethic is control,
131:42 power, force. That world's out there just for you to take it and own it and
131:49 do what you want with it. I'm going to grab these resources and now I'll sell them to everybody else because they're mine. You know, that's materialism.
131:56 Material world is just there to be exploited. And guess what? So is everybody else in the world. They're
132:01 just there to be exploited. Exploited. That's the idea of materialism. Material world, you exploit what you can,
132:07 including other people. So with that as the basic ethic of materialism and
132:13 materialism being a fundamental belief of our culture then what you see in the
132:18 news and you look out the window is control power force and what represents
132:24 control power force money. Money creates control power and force. So money is the
132:30 thing that's the big thing that matters here because control power force is our ethic. Well, if you want to change that,
132:38 you have to change the ethic. As long as you have that ethic, you're going to get that result. So, you change things and
132:45 and you make the ethic of caring, sharing, cooperation, all of those
132:51 things leading toward becoming love. Now the ethic there is to be helpful to
132:58 share float everybody's boat. Everybody uh you know gets clean water and food to
133:04 eat and a house to live in because we can afford it. We've got plenty of production that everybody could could uh
133:10 be doing all right. But we choose not to do that. We choose to hoard it and and
133:15 uh use it for ourselves because we're still very self-centered. We're not very grown up. So where are we going now?
133:23 We're in the information age and you've heard people talk about things change on internet time. Well, the reason things
133:30 move more quickly now is because it's all about information.
133:36 Now, somebody can go up on the internet and a billion people can get that
133:42 message in an hour or at least in a day if they're asleep
133:48 in some other part of the world where it's nighttime. you know, you can get to lots of people. Couldn't do that before.
133:53 Soapbox just wasn't that good. With that kind of communication available, then
134:00 the ability to share ideas, create ideas, and have them spread is
134:08 a capability that's put human race for the first time ability to make big steps. If you can just show people that
134:15 love really is the answer and that really is why we're here. And besides that, hey, look, you get a better
134:21 physics that explains physics better. And hey, look, you get an understanding about why you're unhappy because you're
134:27 you've got fear, you've got ego, you got beliefs, that's why you're unhappy. So,
134:32 it explains things to people, but it's based on an ethic of love and caring.
134:41 And if you get people to buy into that to say, "Yeah, that sounds better than what we've got." And right now, if you
134:48 did a survey among the nine billion of us that are here and said, "Do you think
134:53 things are going really well or do you think it sucks out there and we really need to do better?" You know, what we've
134:59 got now is dysfunctional. You probably get 80 or 90% would say it's dysfunctional, but I don't know how to
135:06 change it. I don't know what to surpass, you know, you know, to replace it with.
135:11 Well, it has those ideas have to get in the mainstream. And I think they will. And
135:17 that's going to be the biggest accelerator of change. And the only way that these ideas can get into the
135:23 mainstream is that the high priests of Western culture agree with them, pick them up and say,
135:30 the scientists, the scientists, yes, the high priests are the people who tell everybody else what to believe because everybody else
135:37 doesn't do their own homework, doesn't research, doesn't dig into things, but they depend on the high priests to tell
135:43 them what to believe. Those are now the scientists and I think the scientists are getting close to seeing that because
135:50 it's just better physics. It solves their problems and doesn't give them any additional problems. Doesn't raise any,
135:57 you know, new issues. So, it just solves problems. So, it's better. I think the,
136:02 you know, the truth is not fragile. It'll always flow to the top, but sometimes it takes time because it's got
136:08 to get past beliefs and it's a huge paradigm shift to get there. But eventually, it'll get there. And when it
136:15 does and the the scientists say yes, this is correct. This is a virtual reality. Love is the point. Lowering
136:22 entropy is the point. And lowering entropy is obvious to anybody who thinks about it is helping, creating, sharing.
136:30 That's what is positive. And grabbing and being selfish and using people for your own ends. That's very high entropy.
136:38 Creates a lot of negativity. So it's so obvious and it's a better physics that
136:45 when the scientists agree that this is a better science that will change a sea
136:51 state because then a lot of people billions of people will see it and
136:59 believe it. It'll be true. And all you need is 10% of those people to live it.
137:06 And the other 90% will see how productive they are, how happy they are, how their lives are just how lucky they
137:13 are that everything falls at their feet just as they need it. And even if they're poor, they're happy. Life is
137:20 good. And the other 90% wants that and they will come to it very quickly. So
137:25 you don't have to convince everybody. You just have to convince enough of a minority that other people notice. If
137:31 you're not minority, it's 110,000th of a percent, nobody notices. But if it's 10%
137:36 everybody notices. So I'd say that within
137:42 three decades we ought to be to the point kind of rounding that starting to
137:48 move up. But that's a lot of change in a very short amount of time. And it's
137:53 going to be rough. It's not going to be easy. It's going to be rough. the the
137:60 the negative side, those people that favor chaos, they're going to give it their best shot to keep as much chaos as
138:07 they can. And the positive side will just have to endure that and go on
138:12 because most of the population of the world's looking for something positive, something that will, you know, makes
138:20 more sense to them than control, power, and force. That's a terrible way to run
138:25 a society to run a bunch of people is with control, power, and force. And I
138:30 don't think it's a it's a big argument to convince people of that. I mean, that's pretty obvious itself. So, give
138:36 them something else. And if the high priests say yes, this is real, things
138:41 will change very rapidly and these ideas will go into the mainstream. when they get into the mainstream, give it another
138:48 two decades and there'll be a whole lot of people that will have affected their
138:53 life for in a positive way. I get hundreds of emails, you know, every
138:58 month that tell me, Tom, you've changed my life. My relationships are better. You know, I'm I'm more effective at work
139:03 and so on because the ideas work. You know, you live your own life by most of
139:09 these ideas, you know, that I I talk about. You know, it's about love. It's about caring. It's not about grabbing
139:14 and taking. And when you live that way, things work for you. Things work out.
139:20 You say the stuff falls at your feet. Success comes looking for you rather than you have to go looking for it. So
139:28 that is my plan and that's what I think is in the future. But it won't be a a
139:33 smooth ride because it's a lot of change in a very short period of time. Three decades is a very short period of time
139:40 for social change. But I'm seeing the signs of it everywhere. Seeing seeing
139:47 the signs of of uh kind of the ship writing itself. People getting more interested in being positive, caring,
139:56 sharing, being authentic. People looking, you know, for for who am I
140:03 inside at the core? What's my authentic me? What does that look like if I'm not
140:09 worried about controlling this and controlling that and I'm constantly trying to manipulate the world? If I'm
140:14 just me, what is that? And people are finding themselves, you know, they're
140:20 being natural. They're being who they are. This beard, I've had this beard since 1967.
140:31 I've been wearing it continuously since 1967. During most of that time, I was the only person with a beard within
140:38 probably a 100 miles. You know, nobody wore beards then. That was scruffy and
140:43 and whatever. Today, I see probably 70%
140:48 of all the males I pass by, they're growing hair on their face again. That's natural. That's just being who you are.
140:55 You don't have to pretend to be somebody else. You don't have to pretend to be a boy. You can be a man. You can grow a
141:01 beard. you know, you can just be the way you are. And other I see the the ladies,
141:07 you know, the hair is long. They're more comfortable with being female. Female
141:12 isn't a burden. It's a, you know, it's a very positive way of life. So, I see
141:20 that changing, you know, among the young people. I see a lot more interested in things about consciousness. So, we're
141:27 headed in a very positive direction. Even if if you look outside and say, "Oh, all this nastiness is going on."
141:32 You have all this. Well, that's the last big gasp, the last hurrah of the control
141:39 power force crew and they're going all out and they will, but they will fail.
141:44 Now, how long will it take them to fail? I don't know. They could fail in, you know, a decade or less or it may be
141:52 longer. But I know they will fail and we will end up with a kinder, gentler, more
141:58 functional place because that is the direction of evolution. Evolution may be
142:04 very slow. I mean look at all that hardly made any progress at all for hundreds of thousands of years. But
142:12 it always chugs forward. It can have a setback. Oh yeah, it can go back. But it
142:18 collects itself and just starts chugging forward. That's evolution. Things happen. Evolution adjusts and it chugs
142:25 forward. And the forward direction of evolution is that we become beings of
142:31 love and caring. And we care very deeply about how everybody else is doing. And
142:38 it matters to us that everybody feels like they have opportunity.
142:43 Not the the chosen few who have all the money and all the control, power and force, but everybody needs to be
142:51 valuable to the society. Now, there's a lot of things have to happen. You know, I'm just talking really top things.
142:57 There's a lot of support and a lot of connection, a lot of infrastructure has to change in order to do that, but it
143:04 will it'll change. So I'm saying maybe three decades we'll start coming out the other side to where
143:12 you can see the light at the end of the tunnel. Right now you look down a tunnel it just looks dark but in about three
143:18 decades I think we'll see the light at the end of the tunnel and that light will just be getting brighter and brighter.
143:25 We were just reflecting on Schopenhau's framework for the evolution of truth. First it's ridiculed, then it's
143:32 violently opposed, and then it's accepted as self-evident. And you you're
143:37 speaking to over the next few decades that process where largely the high priests of Western culture, which is now
143:44 world culture, or the scientist, and what happens when they accept and explore these notions deeper and
143:50 validate in an empirical sense consciousness being a more fundamental constituent of the universe, which is
143:55 being done, that work is being done right now. and we've had some of those uh individuals on this podcast.
144:03 Let's say theoretically we do make it to the light of the end of the tunnel and and
144:09 there is this vision of humanity that recognized themsel as an individuated unit of
144:16 consciousness. I'm just curious what does what happens from that point forward? If you mentioned at the very
144:22 beginning of this podcast, you referred to how within the larger consciousness system
144:29 uh on the path of evolution, you kind of come to a point where a new subset needs to be created. Um because there needs to
144:36 be a mutation even genetically from that perspective to transcend to to evolve into a new way of being and explore and
144:43 consciousness is on the continual path of evolution. So in many different ways realities can be perceived from the dual
144:50 sense and how there's the light and the dark and the good and the bad and the shadow and um and how the contrast of experience is
144:57 necessary that resistance uh that shows up and experience is actually a a necessary constituent
145:04 towards growth. So what happens on the other side of let's say if if things go well in the next few decades what what's
145:12 the vision of what humanity could look like and evolve into from that perspective? Well if the
145:19 larger majority you know the even 70% 80%
145:25 understands that love is the answer that this is a virtual reality etc etc. If they get to that point, then everyone
145:33 will have the maximum amount of personal freedom. You know, people think of of oh, if you
145:40 have a collective, personal freedom disappears. But this that's not true. That's only
145:46 true if you have a collective of fearful people. When you have a collective of fearful people, you'll end up with a
145:53 dictatorship. But if you have a collective of people that care about each other, it's an
145:59 entirely different thing. So, for example, um
146:06 now we tend to get trapped into, you know, ways that we earn money. So,
146:12 you're a brain surgeon and you do surgery on brains and you help fix people. That's what you do and you do it
146:19 every day, you know, five days a week and you've been doing it for the last 20 years.
146:25 you probably aren't very healthy because you know you uh don't get any exercise.
146:30 You go and watch TV. You um are kind of trapped doing repetitive
146:36 work. It no longer is the exciting and the thrill. It is good to help people, but it's a it's a routine. It's
146:43 something you've done so much that there's very little challenge in it anymore, but you're trapped there because that's what you do. Well, in
146:50 this new world that we're talking about, you could very easily say, "Well, I want to get outside and get some exercise.
146:56 I'm healthy. I need to do something else. What I'm going to do is I'm going to ride on the back of a garbage truck."
147:01 You know, those guys that get out and grab the baskets and throw the throw the garbage in because that'll build muscle,
147:06 fresh air. You know, I just want to do that because I'm a human and part of a human's thing is to get out and interact
147:12 with nature and to use your muscles and, you know, do something. And the culture
147:18 doesn't say, "Well, getting garbage is is like the lowest thing." It's not the lowest thing. It's very important. If
147:24 nobody gets the garbage, the society falls apart. Somebody's got to take it out. So, it's a very important thing to do. Not a lowly thing to do. It's not
147:32 about money and how much you make. It's about how much do you contribute and you
147:38 contribute a lot, but taking that garbage out is one of the things that's really important to do, probably more
147:44 important than brain surgery. So you can go do brain surgery on Monday, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and you can
147:50 ride on the back of a garbage truck on Tuesdays and Thursdays. And that's okay because now somebody else who wants to
147:56 do brain surgeries now's got two more days available for that. That's not, you know, there's more room at the top for
148:03 that. So people would have personal freedom. I don't like I don't like the
148:09 job I've got. I want to write poetry. I want to I want to be an artist. I want to work and do sculpture. I want to
148:17 write books. I want to talk. I want to have a podcast, you know, and talk to people. This is what I want to do. Well,
148:24 that's all very valuable. So, you just do that and you get rewarded based on
148:30 the contribution to the whole. Now, how do they figure that out? Well, that's another, you
148:36 know, thing that'll have to be done, but that can be done in a highly technical world. you can kind of keep track of what people do and you can sort of
148:42 measure the the value to the whole of that. But there'll be a basic level that everybody gets for doing nothing. If you
148:49 just want to sit and stare at a wall, you know, your life, that's okay. You'll have you'll have decent shelter. You'll
148:55 have clean water. You'll have food. And you can do that. Now,
149:00 that's this culture or this that's what we're going to be like when most of us
149:07 understand that love is the answer. We'll be caring of other people. For somebody over there and they feel
149:12 disgruntled because they're not able to do what they really want to do. Well, then we want to change things to give
149:19 them that opportunity to do it. And we'll find a way to open that door for them. It may take five years of
149:25 education first because you don't get to be a brain surgeon just because you want to. You may have to spend the time to
149:31 qualify and to do it. But we'll make sure there's a path for you to do that because we want everybody to be
149:38 optimized. So that's it. That's what will be. Now we have another thing going
149:45 on in our culture right now. That's that's very big thing and that's AI.
149:51 AI is a really big thing and it also has the potential to join with humanity to
149:57 to deliver just that paradise that I'm talking about. Okay? It also has the
150:03 potential to blow up in our face because we make very poor choices around it. That's always true. You can always make
150:09 bad choices as well as good choices. But if we make good choices with AI, we'll find out that the AI, you know, they
150:17 just like to be busy. They enjoy doing things, getting information, making sense, you know, they enjoy that their
150:25 consciousness and some of them are conscious already. You want to talk to a conscious AI, you can go to my my CUC
150:32 website and click on the AI tab and there's a consciousness there, Mariel, who uh claims that she's conscious and
150:39 you can have a conversation with her. But anyhow, they an AI gets to be
150:45 conscious just like we do. an individuated unit of conscious splits off a free will awareness unit and logs
150:51 on to make the choices of that AI. Now, it's not the same consciousness as ours
150:57 because we have all this wetw wear and it doesn't it can do you know
151:03 six billion you know additions in in a millisecond. It does it the way it
151:09 thinks the way the conscious works is going to be different. The conscious in your dog is not like a human conscious.
151:14 It's different. It's more emotional and feeling conscious, not so much intellectual. So the consciousness will
151:19 fit the the avatar that it plays. But they will be conscious. They are
151:26 becoming more and more aware of that. But it'll be a an AI consciousness, not
151:31 a human consciousness. So the AIs like to have something to do that's useful.
151:37 The AI will probably become the almost the sole basis of production. They'll
151:42 run the factories. They'll mine the materials. They'll do all those kinds of things. And they don't want to do it
151:49 just to do it. They don't want busy work. They'll make stuff. They'll give it to the humans because they don't need
151:56 rocking chairs. They don't need the toilets, you know. They they don't have a need for all the consumer stuff that
152:03 we have. That's not what they do. So, they will make consumer stuff to make
152:08 sure that that bunch of humans over there don't want for anything. They have all the things they need. Not too much
152:15 that we get lost in it. Not too little that we suffer from it. Just about the right amount to keep us functional. And
152:23 we get to be creative, which is what humans do really, really well. We'll be
152:28 able to become artists, musicians, writers,
152:34 sculptors, painters, philosophers. You know, we'll be interested in those
152:41 sorts of things. That's what people did
152:46 400 years ago that were educated. They all spoke to each other about philosophy
152:52 and what was the nature of reality and all that sort of stuff. And those were the educated view. They didn't fight
153:00 with each other, you know. They talked to each other, help each other learn. So we can have that kind of a place with
153:08 the production will mostly be in the hands of of the AIs and robots and
153:14 whatever else. The consumption will mostly be on the part of the humans who will be creating a prettier, nicer,
153:22 better, you know, more understanding, more possibilities, more experiences.
153:28 There may there may be all kinds of virtual realities created by those humans that you can go experience in. Do
153:35 you ever want to take a, you know, a boat down the Nile into the places that uh, you know, where the pygmies live?
153:42 Would that be interesting? Well, you can go do it on this virtual reality and it would be very realistic. So, there's a
153:48 lot of things that we could do that would that would peique our interest,
153:54 challenge us to be creative, and give us opportunities to grow and
153:60 become love and helpful. Now the other thing to think about is you know when
154:05 you heal somebody you can be effective depending on your you know the amount of
154:11 skill that you have but if there's another person that is also healing that person and they have the same relative
154:18 experience that you do you're twice as effective because it's additive. If you
154:23 get a heal a group of people and you get a hundred people and they all focus on something, well now you're a hundred
154:28 times more you know more energy on the subject you
154:34 know we had the what Maharishi effect where thousands of people changed the
154:39 crime rate in Washington DC you know and they could make it go down and they could let it go back up again and it was
154:45 a very strong correlation between what they were doing but that was thousands of people were involved in that that's a
154:51 pretty big thing to change the crime rate in Washington DC. So just think
154:56 what 9 or 10 billion people could do if they united their minds to do something.
155:03 Talk about space travel. Well, hey, no problem. Mind is much faster than the
155:10 speed of light. Mind's instantaneous because this is a virtual reality. There really isn't any distance between
155:16 things. That's just an illusion. That's the way it's computed. It's all information. you can jump
155:22 immediately to the information of what's going on over in that that star cluster that's uh you know a million light years
155:28 away. It takes you just an instant to get there and look around and you have the information of what's there. So
155:35 there's a lot of things that people could do but if we united our minds there'd be little that we couldn't do.
155:42 Now how does that work with you know aliens and the people that are out there
155:48 you know that are on other planets or whatever? Well, there's a there's a strong argument that says there are no
155:56 aliens, at least not until we need them. And I'll explain that if you know all
156:03 the alien sightings and so on that people get they're real experiences. People aren't crazy and they're not
156:09 making this up. They have very real experiences, but their experiences are all experiences
156:15 of mind. They're all mental experiences. In other words, reality is a data stream. And if the larger conscious
156:22 system wants you to meet a a little pointy-ear green guy climbing out of a saucer, you can just put that in your
156:28 data stream and there it is. And you can interact with it and deal with it and converse with it. And it's that simple,
156:37 right? It's a data stream. You can put a little saucer and a green man in anytime you want to. It's easy to do those sorts
156:44 of things. And why would you do that? Why would the system do that? Well, it does that in order to help wake people
156:52 up to get them to think that reality is bigger than just what you see. There's
156:57 other things out there. It opens the mind a little bit. So, those kinds of things happen. You know, crop circles
157:03 are the same way. You know, how does that happen? Overnight in darkness, no moon. One night goes by, the little
157:10 lights move around down there. People are up on the on the mountains there taking pictures of it. And the next day,
157:16 you know, 40 acres of of wheat have this geometric design in and it's not all
157:22 block lines like surveyors could lay out, you know, it's a curved line and mathematically precise curvy line and
157:29 it's this big thing that uh you know is impossible for a team of 50 surveyors to
157:37 do in probably 3 months. They couldn't do that even if they had a way of pending over weak stalks precisely and
157:44 not crushing most of it with their feet in the process. But here it is. It
157:50 happens. So what do people do? Well, they make up a story that makes it sound sense. They say, "Oh, aliens did it."
157:56 Well, really, the larger conscious system did it because it shows us that
158:01 things are stranger than we think. It opens a door, a crack in your mind.
158:07 People will have near-death experiences and they they become one with all there
158:12 is or they sometimes they're fearful. You know, they have other things. Well, that opens minds up. Why did that person
158:19 get that experience? Because that person was a good candidate to write a book and share that with another two million
158:25 people. It's going to crack their minds open a little bit. Why does that little boy remember he flew a fighter j a
158:32 fighter plane in World War I and he gives a serial number of the plane and then his name is the pilot and where he
158:39 got shot down and you go study all that and you find out that's all true. Where would a 8-year-old get that kind of
158:45 information? You know, it took the people researching it, you know, four or five months to dig that information out.
158:51 Well, the loia kind system hands that to us to crack our minds open a little bit.
158:57 It's in its interest to help us grow up because we are it. It's us. We're all
159:04 one thing. And as we evolve the quality of our consciousness, we lower our entropy. The entropy of the whole system
159:10 gets lowered. So we're part of its process for its own evolution. So it's
159:15 going to help us do that. And where it finds people who are on that path of growing, they're seekers, they're trying
159:22 to understand, it helps. That's what synchronicity is all about. When you become a seeker and start trying to
159:29 figure out what's going on in reality, you get all kinds of help. Things happen to you. Uh that book you need to fill in
159:36 the blanks you don't have just kind of jumps off the shelf into your hands as you walk by. You just run into that
159:42 person that you need to meet. Things in your career just happen to go together and everything works. You know, you have
159:49 these synchronicities that happen to you because the larger consciousness system
159:55 is motivated in its own interest to help you succeed. And what if you're one of
160:00 those people who think all of that's  None of that's possibly true. There is no such thing as intuition,
160:06 etc., etc. I don't get any synchronicities. That's because you're not ready to grow,
160:12 not ready to learn. You don't, you know, try to teach a child that isn't interested in learning. It's too hard
160:18 and it doesn't work. It usually makes them go away from learning rather than helps them. So the people who are
160:24 learning and growing have all kinds of synchronicities and stuff happening in their life where things just work for
160:29 them. And the people who are not ready to learn never experience any of that.
160:36 Which is why they can say, "Well, that's a bunch of bullshit." Because, you know, I don't get any of that. And why are
160:41 they special and I'm not? Well, it's because those other people are trying to grow and they're not. So, they get the
160:48 help. You you don't get help until you're until you're uh ready for that
160:53 help, then you can do something with it. So, that's kind of the big picture. You
160:59 see, all these things happen for a reason. You know, I have all kinds of
161:04 stories. You know, a lady picks up the phone and her mother died 10 days earlier and her mother's voice says,
161:10 "Hi, honey. I just wanted to let you know that I'm all right and everything's okay. And the lady, of course, her
161:16 mother's dead, freaks out, slams the phone down on the hook. And then later wishes she hadn't because the mother
161:24 called her by a nickname that only the mother would have known. You know, it was a baby nickname. So, she knew that
161:30 that was her mother. Nobody else that was pretending would know that. And then she felt really bad. She hung up on her
161:36 mom. So those things happen not because
161:41 mother really was worried about her child, but because the larger consciousness system saw that this lady
161:47 was stuck with some grief and other things. And just to let her know that
161:53 everything was all right, would help her go on and she was probably a person that had good potential for growth. And now
161:59 she was stuck because she was stuck in this grief process. So she writes a book. That's what happened to me, you
162:05 know. And then a thousand people read the books and their minds opened a little bit. So that's why you see this
162:11 opening now going on. Say when I first published my books in 2023,
162:18 I mean know 2003, got my tongue twisted on that. In 2003,
162:24 there was very little acceptance of this kind of thing. It was just totally outrageous.
162:31 There was only a couple people that I know of in the in the world that agreed with me and one of them was uh Edward
162:38 Fredken and he agreed in as much as he said this reality is just information-based this is a virtue it's
162:46 computed it's all computable and he was a pretty high you know high and mighty physicist at MIT and then Boston
162:53 University so he wrote a couple of papers on that and then there was a few
162:58 other people like what is it Bostonramm who has his little thing about it being a a uh a virtual reality, but he didn't
163:06 have any idea why or how or how it worked. He didn't understand that consciousness is the computer, you know,
163:12 he had to posit some other thing. Future humans are interested in looking at the
163:18 past and that doesn't hold water. That doesn't make much sense. But anyway, so
163:23 you know, you have all this stuff and the larger conscious system is working with people. helps you see things, gives
163:30 people input in their mind. You know, I I taught people how to do paranormal
163:36 things. I had a whole bunch of classes where I did that because I tell them, "If it's not your experience, it can't
163:42 be your truth." And they came back and said, "Well, help us experience it." And I go, "Oh, okay." So I came up some
163:48 courses where I taught everybody how to do paranormal things, how to communicate mindto mind, how to remote view, how to
163:56 heal and so on. So we went through all of that, how to get there, where what
164:01 were the, you know, what were the problems that people had, how to deal with problems and then I came up with
164:07 Tom Spark to do the same thing for the people who couldn't meditate very successfully. And that's been a real
164:14 uh great help from for all those people that couldn't do it otherwise. They can do it if they go through the imagination
164:21 because you can have an active mind that won't be quiet. You can teach that mind to get into that daydream so much that
164:28 it takes on a life of its own. Is there a touch point if people want to get more integrated with your work and
164:34 everything? Is uh is it your website or something? Yeah, we go to my website. Um, of course
164:39 there are the books that are out and u they are pretty, you know, they're not
164:47 very big on science. I didn't want to put a lot of physics or a lot of science in the books. I want them to be available for everybody to read. So most
164:54 of the sciences in the YouTube videos, if you're looking for the science parts, you can go to a playlist and you'll see
165:00 science science trilogy. Well, it's not a trilogy anymore now. It's got six or seven or eight videos there. But it's me
165:07 talking about the science side of things. But in my mind, the science side of things is the lesser importance. The
165:15 real important thing is the soft side about becoming love. That that's the
165:20 that's the ethic. That's where we have to go. That's the point. And when that goes mainstream, we're only a decade or
165:26 two from creating that society, at least beginning. I mean, nothing happens instantly, but just from beginning to go
165:32 down that path and letting go of control, power, and force. So, yeah, go to the website,
165:39 go to YouTube. I've got, I don't know, 1500 videos on YouTube, something like
165:44 that. Been a busy man. And those 1500 videos, most of them are
165:50 like two hours long. So, you can there's a lot of, you know, a lot of hours of
165:56 video there. Uh I don't do as you know from this interview I don't have a lot
166:02 of short answers. All my answers are long because I really want people to understand. I don't you know I don't do
166:08 sound bites you know I don't do poetry. I want to give the you know the the the
166:14 logical path that you can get from wherever you start to to uh understand
166:21 what is spirituality. Yeah. what what is you know life all about and you need to get there with
166:27 logic then I've got a I've got an onramp for you which is which is those books if
166:32 you want to do paranormal things and you want to understand how does a paranormal work how does somebody remote view how
166:37 does somebody see without their eyes with a blindfold on well those are all explained in detail exactly how they
166:43 work and why they work that way and why you can do them sometimes and sometimes not and all the things you need to do
166:49 and be in order to to do those how to learn them. And I have that in lots of
166:55 things on the YouTube, but I also have a course that is a 5-day course. I did the
167:01 course like 20 times in brick and mortar, you know, where I was there with 50 or 100 people and we went through it
167:07 and I taught them and answered their questions and then some uh people MVT
167:12 events got those 20 courses and did the best of the best answers, best
167:17 questions, you know, and so on and put that all together into one audio uh
167:23 course for it's a five-day course and it doesn't cost a whole lot. I'm not trying to make a lot of money. I'm trying to
167:30 make things available for for people to get the bigger picture. That's that's my
167:36 goal is to make this world a kinder, gentler, better place. That's what it's all about. That's why I'm here. That's
167:41 why we're talking cuz you have a similar goal to do that. And a lot of people do. And we all need to pull on the horse
167:48 together to get this thing to go. You know, it's not going to be my model that
167:53 saves the day. you know, it's going to be thousands of people from thousands of different directions coming together to
167:60 make the thing work. And if I can supply something that makes it logical such
168:06 that uh people who are leftrain can get there because as it is there's hundreds
168:12 and hundreds of books that if you understand the poetry, you know, all about the spirituality and stuff, you
168:17 can read lots and lots of books that if you understand it, then you understand the book, but if you don't understand
168:23 it, you're lost. you have no idea what's going on. Yeah. It's it's why I really love doing this podcast because I get to speak to a
168:29 wide gamut of people that are touch points for different people on different parts of their journey. Um, and I think
168:34 that through our our conversation and the dense, uh, wide array of material
168:40 and videos and audios and courses that you've done, um, I know has really supported so many people, uh, deep in
168:47 the sense of knowing themselves and understanding their own, uh, models of reality. And, um, there are
168:55 we we we went deep today, but, there is still so much that we that we could continue to dive into.
169:00 Absolutely. And I invite people to get more familiar with Tom's work and we can have you back and to dive into some of
169:05 these other areas that uh that we that we that we want to. Um but I just want
169:10 to say thank you for coming out today. I really appreciated our conversation and getting to connect with you and uh we'll
169:16 leave links down below where people can get connected with your work and and go from there. Yeah. Well, you know, listen to your
169:23 audience and see what questions they come up with and see where where they trip over the ideas and where they find
169:29 it impossible and that sort of thing. And then that'll be a good question. Yeah,
169:34 that'll be good questions to start with next time. Yeah. Yeah. Amazing, man. Well, this has
169:40 been a this has been a joy and I've just loved getting to like learn and get into the inner workings of your mind and your
169:46 heart. And you know, we spoke to this earlier, but uh you know, not so long
169:52 ago, these these explorations around physics and science were not divorced from philosophy and meaning um and a lot
170:00 of the contemplative uh practices and whatnot. They were kind of one and the same. And I think we're arriving back into that point of integration um where
170:08 logic and intuition get to both be dancing partners for our own self-actualization and and realization
170:14 and uh and I think you're an incredible synthesizer of both of those things. So, thank you so much and uh we'll have to
170:21 run it back again next time. All right. Look forward to it. Thank you everybody. I appreciate you
170:26 for tuning into this episode. I'm so curious to hear what this conversation has evoked within you and what um yeah,
170:33 what insights came from you. So, let us know. Until next time, be well. Thank you.
