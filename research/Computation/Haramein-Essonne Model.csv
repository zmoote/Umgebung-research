"Aspect","What the combined model says","Where it ties into the SM","Where it ties into cosmology"
"Particle masses","The proton, neutron and other hadrons are treated as tiny Schwarzschild‑black‑hole‐like “holographic spheres” whose mass comes from the vacuum‑energy density on their holographic screens.  The holographic mass formula of Haramein reproduces the measured rest masses when the Planck‑scale geometry is used, and the same vacuum energy that gives the mass is identified by Essonne with the ether density that drives gravity.  This eliminates the need for an ad‑hoc Higgs‑boson mass parameter; the mass is a geometric consequence of the vacuum field.","The SM’s Higgs mechanism is re‑interpreted as a property of the ether’s energy density.  The Higgs field is simply the gradient of the vacuum energy that also generates the holographic mass.  This offers a geometric origin for the Yukawa couplings that appear in the SM Lagrangian.","The same vacuum energy that gives particle masses also contributes to the cosmic energy budget, providing a natural source for the observed dark‑energy density."
"Gauge interactions","Haramein’s holographic surface is a 2‑D manifold that can support “stretched‑string” excitations.  The quantum of angular momentum (Planck‑scale spin) on the surface acts as a source for the SU(3), SU(2) and U(1) gauge fields.  Essonne’s ether fluid supplies the medium in which these excitations propagate, and the gradient of the ether’s pressure gives the confining potential that reproduces the short‑range strong force (Yukawa‑like).","The EM and weak forces emerge from the same holographic excitations but with different boundary conditions on the surface, matching the SM’s gauge symmetry structure.  The coupling constants are not fundamental but arise from the geometry and the ether’s equation of state.","The gauge‑field dynamics are frozen into the expansion of the universe: the energy stored in the holographic screens scales with the scale factor, naturally leading to a decaying effective cosmological constant at late times."
"Neutrino masses","In the holographic picture, neutrinos correspond to the smallest possible excitations of the vacuum surface (Planck‑scale loops).  Their tiny masses are a direct consequence of the extremely small radius of the holographic sphere that can support such a mode, again eliminating the need for a separate Majorana mass term.","The SM neutrino sector is therefore understood as a subset of the holographic spectrum, with mixing angles determined by the relative orientations of the underlying surface excitations.","The relic neutrino background is simply the thermalized spectrum of vacuum excitations, contributing a small but measurable fraction to the total radiation density in the early universe."
"Dark matter","The model naturally predicts a class of massive, weakly interacting holographic excitations that are stable because they are topologically protected.  These “holographic dark‑matter particles” carry mass from the vacuum energy but couple only through gravity and the ether pressure gradient.","Their interaction cross‑sections are suppressed by the Planck scale, matching the phenomenology of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) without requiring new fields beyond the SM.","Their abundance is set by the freeze‑out of holographic excitations in the early universe, leading to the observed dark‑matter density."
"Inflation","A rapid expansion can be driven by a temporary phase where the ether pressure is suddenly high (γ≈2) and the holographic surface undergoes a self‑similar fractal growth.  Essonne’s work shows that the ether pressure can naturally take the value 10^35 J/m³ needed for inflation.","During this phase the SM fields are trapped on the expanding holographic surface; their vacuum fluctuations become the seeds for the cosmic microwave background anisotropies.","After inflation ends, the ether pressure relaxes to its present value, leaving a small residual vacuum energy that manifests as the cosmological constant Λ. Essonne’s calculation of Λ∞ from the ether pressure gives a value close to the observed dark‑energy density. <source_id data=""4"" title=""energy-of-the-vacuum-basic-brick-for-the-great-unification-of-physics.pdf"" />"
