"-They will continue to evolve until Source integrates them again. You see, Evolution is breathing. Out, and in, and out... infinitely. With each inspiral, the Creator integrates the learning.

-Like a living organism, Thor Han adds pensively.

-Yes, Angkar Vaiel confirms. It is a living organism.

-Are there many others of its kind?

-This, Vaiel replies, we don't know... yet.

-Imagine, I say. Imagine... if there were other beings like the Source Creator, there should surely be an infinite number of them. But then... would they come from a Super-Creator singularity being?

-And, Thor Han adds, the story would repeat on a larger scale, in infinite fractals...

I close my eyes, as my consciousness is seized by vertigo.

-This awareness, the Architect continues, brings us back to the fundamental of our existence: the momentum. Here and now is where we live. Where we ARE. And this is the only thing that matters. Momentum encompasses eternity. This is where our creative power lies. In the momentum we create our reality at the speed of light. If we cease to exist right now, all this around us will fade from our perception. It won't be there, it won't evolve. It will become oblivion, merging into the Time Field. With each time fractal we create the next one. We are the Creator. Can you see it?"
                                          
"When I open my eyes, everything around me has changed. The rocks, the mountain, the city, the clouds... even our three bodies... look like a glowing holographic web of dots. I have seen this before; The Nine once showed me the mathematical structure of creation and it looked exactly like this. And then... I gathered my intention in the center of my head and activated the glowing crystal at the site of my pineal gland. Wherever I looked, as if I were blowing a conscious wind, I could move the dots with the sole power of my intention, reorganize them, create other shapes."
