Thor Han Eredyon says that, if all goes well, our society will finally

be part of the intergalactic community by 2027.

Musk plans to send uncrewed Starships to Mars in 2026,
and then crewed flights in 2028.

My thoughts:

Musk is likely giving those years as a guideline, which I assume
will change as DJT releases information to the public.

2025 will be the first real step into disclosure,
and by the end of DJT's presidency, we will be empowered for the better.

Elena:

More and more ships are showing up in the skies.

Unmanned Drones.

Disclosure plan is going full steam ahead

January 21st 2025 will mark the first real step of disclosure

Val Thor will reveal himself to the public when the time is right
