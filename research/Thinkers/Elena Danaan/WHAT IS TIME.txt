00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:42,400
Hello everyone. Can everyone hear me?

2
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:45,200
Um,

00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:53,519
Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. We have I'm

5
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:56,519
trying to get rid of this um

6
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:56,519
video.

7
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:03,480
Ah, here we go.

8
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,480
That's me.

9
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:10,319
Good evening everyone or morning in

10
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:13,760
regarding where you are. Uh do you have

11
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:16,799
sounds now? Can you hear me perfectly?

12
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:20,560
Yes. Hello. Yes, everyone. Oh, that's a

13
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:22,880
lot of Yes. Um so, thank you very much

14
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:29,040
for being here tonight. It's going to be

15
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:31,759
an amazing webinar. Um I think because

16
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:35,199
there is a knowledge here that I have

17
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:38,000
never disclosed before.

18
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:42,400
So you're the lucky ones.

19
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,479
And um this knowledge I have it from two

20
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,000
sources.

21
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:48,560
my

22
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:54,240
endless and regular conversations with

23
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:58,320
Prince Ia, my old friend and also with

24
00:04:54,240 --> 00:05:01,280
some elder called the sea. Cali, the

25
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:03,919
Cula are interdimensional beings. They

26
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:07,440
live in another universe and some of

27
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:08,800
them know a lot about things and it was

28
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:12,800
interesting also to have their

29
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:15,919
perspective and also through what I have

30
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:20,160
seen on board the Nibiru ship in the Mad

31
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:23,360
Kahal library. So all of these combined

32
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:28,120
I am bringing to you tonight

33
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:28,120
what is time?

34
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:35,360
Time,

35
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:37,759
space, and consciousness

36
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:42,720
are the three

37
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:47,440
variables of creation.

38
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:53,039
From time, space and consciousness

39
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:56,160
grows the totality of all that is.

40
00:05:53,039 --> 00:06:00,400
Time, space, and consciousness. They are

41
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:03,360
built upon the same structure,

42
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:07,520
one single structure,

43
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:10,000
what you call the flower of life.

44
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:12,880
I prepared some transparent

45
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,440
um things. I I I've been drawing drawing

46
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:19,680
this. So I went through this drawing

47
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:22,240
this for you. It wasn't easy

48
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:25,039
on the plexiglass. So that's a flower of

49
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:28,560
life. Okay, that you know that it's been

50
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:32,720
present in all the ancient temples of

51
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:39,520
humanity. It's been kept as a knowledge

52
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:42,080
as a key uh from uh by the ancients

53
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:43,759
and for you to come to this day and to

54
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:46,319
show you the secret of the universe.

55
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:50,560
This is the creation. This is the

56
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:53,520
structure the latis of the creation.

57
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:56,800
So before going further in what is

58
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:59,680
exactly this thing

59
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:03,759
um I want to

60
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:06,319
address a warning about of course

61
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:10,319
misinformation counter disclosure

62
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:14,240
counter information all the time this is

63
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:16,080
carved painted sculpted

64
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:20,800
everywhere around the world from

65
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:23,759
memorial times from pre pre younger das

66
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,280
Like for abidos for instance,

67
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:27,919
China,

68
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:31,280
Europe, everywhere, everywhere,

69
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:35,440
everywhere, everywhere.

70
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:38,400
Because this is the greatest secret.

71
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:41,120
We could say this is God.

72
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:45,280
the counter intelligence and the enemies

73
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:47,599
of humanity, the leil faction, they try

74
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:49,840
to

75
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:53,520
to to

76
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:55,039
take you away from this knowledge.

77
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:57,759
So

78
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:59,680
how to take people away from a knowledge

79
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:02,240
when this knowledge is carved, sculpted

80
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:04,160
and painted in the old temples of

81
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:07,280
humanity?

82
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:09,759
Well, by uh creating a counternarrative

83
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:11,520
that will discredit it. That's what they

84
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:13,840
do. They they've been doing that all

85
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:17,440
along. Creating counternarratives to

86
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:22,240
hijack the reality and make it look as

87
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:24,080
in fact it is the the lie.

88
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:27,280
There's a narrative that's been created

89
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:30,879
that was very well done but very easy to

90
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:32,800
to expose. Uh it's the narrative of the

91
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:35,200
dise.

92
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:37,279
So of course because this is the latis

93
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,519
of creation. This is life. This is

94
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:42,479
source. This is creator. This is how the

95
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:45,760
universe is structured. Um it was

96
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:49,279
necessary uh by the enemy to uh

97
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:51,120
discredit it saying oh that's the not

98
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:53,440
the flower of death. They called it a

99
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,959
daisy of death and they invented another

100
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,600
structure.

101
00:08:54,959 --> 00:09:00,560
Um

102
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:04,000
yes, this is a it is a funny nonsense

103
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:06,160
because this I I'm I'm going to tell you

104
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,760
um

105
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:13,839
this is this been uh this narrative this

106
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:17,680
um scop has been uh carried on by a lady

107
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:21,600
called Ashayana Dean and um it's been

108
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:24,399
also uh taken over after that by another

109
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,920
lady Mrs. Renee,

110
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:30,880
um

111
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:35,200
this when you go into these uh

112
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:38,800
um CIA uh created material, the daisy of

113
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:41,600
death, you you very quickly see their

114
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:44,320
ways of doing and there are publications

115
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:46,320
from documents from the CIA and I know

116
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,000
Dan Willis will find the right link and

117
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,640
the right document because he's here in

118
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,519
the chat

119
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:55,920
that say that He'll find the you'll find

120
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:57,519
the right quote. But this documents I

121
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:03,200
couldn't find it, but I read it

122
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:07,360
somewhere. The CIA said um to

123
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:10,160
there's a tactic to fit um a lie. It's

124
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:13,680
that to make it complicate. When you

125
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:16,880
make it complicate, the people will be

126
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:18,880
um will feel guilty or ashamed not to

127
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:21,920
understand. They will pretend to

128
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:23,920
understand it and they will conform to

129
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:26,560
everyone else even though they don't

130
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:28,399
understand it. And the material of ash

131
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:30,800
Yes, Dan. It's true. The material of

132
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:34,000
Ashayadin is done as such. It's a

133
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:38,959
compound of uh it's things taken from a

134
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:42,399
Jewish cabala. Some um um Middle Eastern

135
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:44,320
traditions and some um mystery schools

136
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:48,240
traditions.

137
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:52,480
It's all a mikmack. You have also names

138
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:54,880
of angels and uh it's a lot of um abraic

139
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,959
things in it. It's a mish mash of a lot

140
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:59,360
of things that people can find reference

141
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:02,640
to existing traditions but it's all

142
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:05,120
mixed together. So uh to make you feel

143
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:08,640
like oh my god this is so complicated it

144
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:12,079
must be true. Spoiler alert,

145
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:14,560
the truth is simple

146
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:16,240
because it speaks to your heart, your

147
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,800
consciousness, and you know, you

148
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:21,760
understand it straight away.

149
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:24,880
This is the truth.

150
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:27,279
This is the flower of life. This is the

151
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:29,760
rose of knowledge, the sacred rose of

152
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:31,600
the alchemist.

153
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:34,959
Now

154
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:38,640
and that said

155
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:41,519
um when you look at this and you see all

156
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:45,920
the the circles in fact all the circles

157
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:48,480
are not flat this is a representation

158
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:51,920
uh two dimensional but in fact it's

159
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:54,640
round it's bubble universe it's spheres

160
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:58,800
well more or less spheres

161
00:11:54,640 --> 00:12:01,680
um and these lines are these these lines

162
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:03,279
are see them in volume. They are

163
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,839
bubbles.

164
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:07,920
Each one is a universe. So that's a

165
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:11,279
blueprint. Okay? It's a blueprint of

166
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:13,120
creation. It's not

167
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:17,040
strictly like this because creation is

168
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:20,000
moving. It's a continuous flow.

169
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:22,480
So

170
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:26,160
the this bubble universe, I'm going to

171
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:29,920
show you something. Um,

172
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:31,760
if if you follow the the the the

173
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:34,160
take a pen. Okay, I'm going to do that.

174
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:37,120
Um,

175
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:41,120
like this.

176
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:44,079
Take a pen. Have a red here. Red.

177
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:46,079
Okay.

178
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:48,959
Not on it. The other side. Yes. I'm

179
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:51,519
going to try to do this.

180
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:54,079
No, I'm going to do it like this. Sorry.

181
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:57,200
First time I'm doing this. Okay. I don't

182
00:12:54,079 --> 00:13:00,959
know if you see that.

183
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:03,959
If No. Okay. I'm going to this side.

184
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:03,959
Okay.

185
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:11,959
These bubbles overlap. You see the

186
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:11,959
overlap? Okay. You see the overlap?

187
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:21,360
If you take

188
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:23,279
a line and you go like this, you change

189
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:26,279
universe. You travel through the

190
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:26,279
universe.

191
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:33,240
You can kind of make a route. Okay.

192
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:40,160
You Oh, you can't find it. No, it's not

193
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:43,360
working. You have a glyph.

194
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:47,320
What I've just done, if I go over with

195
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:47,320
my red pen,

196
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:57,120
you have a glyph,

197
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:58,959
you see?

198
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:02,399
And these glyphs are the

199
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:06,839
interdimensional keys to go from a

200
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:06,839
universe to another.

201
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:15,920
So um

202
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:17,680
I try to make it simple with that.

203
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:20,079
It's you are drawing the pathways

204
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:24,399
between the universes.

205
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:27,120
Okay. You create a route and um

206
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:29,519
it it's

207
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,440
it's it's that that goes from one point

208
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:33,600
to the other of the great design but not

209
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:36,959
flat you know in volume. So these glyphs

210
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:39,760
are what we call interdimensional keys.

211
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:41,839
Um you really must see with your mind

212
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:46,399
that this is not a flat okay it's

213
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:48,160
multi-dimensional holographic construct.

214
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:51,120
So

215
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:54,120
these bubble universes

216
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,120
they

217
00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:01,040
creation comes from for instance the

218
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:03,839
center and it grows. It grows and grows

219
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:06,320
and the universe as they grow

220
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:08,880
they get away from the center and they

221
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:12,480
become more wobbly and more they have

222
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:15,480
their own growth their own

223
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,480
expansion.

224
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:22,480
and sometimes overlap with others and

225
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:26,160
sometimes only for a while.

226
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:30,480
And a universe will grow

227
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:33,519
will be bigger um when it has

228
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:36,920
more densities. The scale of densities

229
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:36,920
is higher

230
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:45,639
longer the longer octave. the song of

231
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:45,639
that universe is a longer octave.

232
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:50,360
So, um,

233
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:55,079
now

234
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:04,240
where does that to show you the universe

235
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:08,000
how it is? That's the body of creation.

236
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:13,000
The body of of creator.

237
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,000
That's what the creator looks like.

238
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:20,959
And how and where does your journey

239
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:24,399
comes into the p picture?

240
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:29,120
Well, we could say at the center of this

241
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:30,959
design, but the center is everywhere.

242
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:33,519
Source

243
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:35,440
creator is

244
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:37,680
her creation.

245
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:40,639
Thorhan says her, so I say her as well.

246
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:44,720
And it's I mean Ia says her. They all

247
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:47,920
say her because it's a a matrix. It's a

248
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:51,440
womb of creation.

249
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:53,920
So a consciousness

250
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:56,480
all the individual individualized

251
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:58,079
consciousness that populate all of

252
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:00,880
creations

253
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:05,679
are fractal

254
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:08,679
from the heart of one consciousness.

255
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:08,679
Okay.

256
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:16,240
We are in the beginning

257
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:19,839
a very small sprout from the soul of the

258
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:24,400
creator. You imagine

259
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:26,480
that there is a oneness of consciousness

260
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:30,880
like a reservoir of consciousness

261
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:33,520
something that has no limit of space and

262
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:36,080
no limit of time. And from this big

263
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:38,320
reservoir of consciousness

264
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:42,160
there are offshoots constantly

265
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:45,280
constantly it just shoots off

266
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:49,280
consc consciousness and fractals of

267
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:51,760
itself fractals of itself.

268
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:54,080
I spoke a lot about this in my book the

269
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:56,240
cedars

270
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:59,360
where I showed me all of this and the

271
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:04,559
nine as well. So you can have this this

272
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:08,080
this experience as well. we can find it.

273
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:11,919
So as we grow, we develop individualized

274
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:13,600
awareness as needed for creator to

275
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:16,960
experience

276
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:21,960
through this fractal of shoots of itself

277
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:21,960
or herself that it sends out.

278
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:29,919
Some souls even choose to experience

279
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:33,320
not just one universe but several

280
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:33,320
different universes.

281
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:41,120
When we fractal

282
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:44,640
from the one creator,

283
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:48,400
as long as we we do not join any

284
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:52,640
planetary evolutionary biometrics

285
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:56,480
and as long as we only choose to observe

286
00:18:52,640 --> 00:19:00,480
worlds on our journey, we remain as a

287
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:04,240
non-incarnated plasmic consciousness

288
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:06,240
fully aware of who we are.

289
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:09,919
We can choose to remain in this state

290
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:12,799
for a while or forever

291
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:16,880
at the start or at the end of our

292
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:22,240
journey. And we'll come back to that.

293
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:25,360
For once we begin incarnation,

294
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:27,520
we forget. We are stuck to complete the

295
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:30,640
whole cycle.

296
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:33,640
We are stuck in the chosen planetary

297
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,640
matrix.

298
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:39,919
I am going to go over this uh planetary

299
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:42,559
matrix um

300
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:46,960
um thing again. I've been explaining

301
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:52,160
this in my last webinar on consciousness

302
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:55,679
but um so your consciousness is an

303
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:58,320
embryo of consciousness and an an a

304
00:19:55,679 --> 00:20:02,559
little thing that is barely aware of

305
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:04,720
them itself. It shoots off into space

306
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:09,600
and there you are

307
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:13,360
an an egg of of all possibilities.

308
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:17,520
And in that this little blob, plasmic

309
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:19,440
blob, it's you and it's in into space.

310
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:23,919
And

311
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:27,600
you are aiming for a planet, a world

312
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:29,039
where your consciousness will anchor and

313
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:33,200
incarnate.

314
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:37,360
in the most simple of

315
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:41,280
life forms and from there start the

316
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:43,360
cycle of incarnations through all the

317
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:46,640
life forms of this planet. all the

318
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:49,200
rains, not all the life forms, but the

319
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:53,600
minerals, vegetital,

320
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:56,320
water, animals, insect until the the

321
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:58,799
most evolved

322
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:01,600
um creature on that planet can be human,

323
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:04,400
can be anything else.

324
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:08,120
As long as you are going through these

325
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:08,120
cycles of incarnation,

326
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:13,440
you

327
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:15,120
are on a journey to remember who you

328
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:18,159
are.

329
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:19,760
And this is creator experiencing

330
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:23,159
evolution

331
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:23,159
through you.

332
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:30,159
And once ex evolution this experience of

333
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:33,280
evolution has completed that you've

334
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:35,760
reached the highest

335
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:37,919
life form the highest stage of life form

336
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:41,200
on that planet.

337
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:43,919
Creator through experience will have

338
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:48,640
grown,

339
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:52,240
nourished itself or herself from

340
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:56,960
not really your experience but

341
00:21:52,240 --> 00:22:00,080
its experience through your journey.

342
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:03,760
Remember you are a fractal of it. You

343
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:05,840
are it and it is you.

344
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:08,400
And when

345
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:11,679
at the end of all the cycles you are

346
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:13,840
ready to go embark for the next step of

347
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:17,600
this journey

348
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:22,159
you you can incarnate in another world

349
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:24,159
another planet but not as

350
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:25,919
going back again from the beginning

351
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:28,880
because that won't be your home your

352
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:32,720
planetary biometric. You have only one

353
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:34,960
home, the planetary biometrics in which

354
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:38,799
your soul, your consciousness has grown

355
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:41,600
and developed from embryo to adult

356
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:43,440
consciousness. But once you've completed

357
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:45,679
these cycles,

358
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:47,520
you are ready to leave home. If you want

359
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:49,360
to, you can stay there and reincarnate

360
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:51,200
all the time on your planet because you

361
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:54,159
like it. It's fine and it's your

362
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:58,080
experience. You can go and incarnate on

363
00:22:54,159 --> 00:23:01,200
then on another planet as the highest

364
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:05,440
life form.

365
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:07,760
These are the star seeds or the envoys

366
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:10,480
who choose to incarnate

367
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:13,520
to come to earth through incarnation not

368
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:17,280
through a stasis pod or we're going to

369
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:19,200
talk about the stasis pod later.

370
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:22,480
There are two ways of being an envoy,

371
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:25,760
right? Through putting your body in

372
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:28,559
stasis, getting out of it, and

373
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:32,320
incarnating into an embryo. But also,

374
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:35,840
you have the choice to die on your home

375
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:38,159
world and follow the natural universal

376
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:41,840
cycle of incarnation and leave your

377
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:44,480
planetary biometrics for good. You can

378
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:48,000
come back, of course, but that's the

379
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:51,440
cycle. So

380
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:56,559
a star seed or envoy

381
00:23:51,440 --> 00:24:00,559
will be someone who can incarnate on

382
00:23:56,559 --> 00:24:03,440
another world by two methods. putting

383
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:06,159
their body in stasis and going back to

384
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:09,440
their body once the incarnation is over

385
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:13,120
or dying on their home world and well

386
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:17,200
completing their last life and moving on

387
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:20,480
to the the incarnation etheric

388
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:22,080
biometrics to another world and stay

389
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,960
there

390
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:27,600
or move afterwards whatever come home if

391
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:32,720
they want to. So you see the difference.

392
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:34,799
But anyway to do to go through the

393
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:39,200
the whole process you need to be at the

394
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:41,919
later stage of your incarnation when on

395
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:44,480
your planet when you decide to go by

396
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:47,279
death and rebirth.

397
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:49,440
When you go in a stasis spod

398
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:51,840
uh it is different.

399
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:54,720
You are not

400
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:58,159
obliged to have completed all your

401
00:24:54,720 --> 00:25:00,880
incarnations on your home world.

402
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:03,919
You just do a job and you come back and

403
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:06,880
you will finish your cycle.

404
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:10,880
Okay, that's two different ways to be a

405
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:14,520
star seed. So that was good to remind uh

406
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,520
to keep in mind.

407
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:22,320
Now

408
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:26,279
we are uh coming into the

409
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:26,279
the heat of the subject.

410
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:32,440
Time is not linear.

411
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:38,799
While you are incarnated into this

412
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:42,080
terran avatar,

413
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:44,720
your other incarnations

414
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:47,360
live too.

415
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:51,559
Now I'm going to ask you to

416
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:51,559
get out of the linear thinking

417
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:59,679
and just for a moment

418
00:25:55,360 --> 00:26:02,799
try to not judge not calculate not try

419
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:04,400
to relate to what you are experiencing

420
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:06,960
here.

421
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:09,120
Just allow your consciousness and your

422
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:11,440
mind to absorb

423
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:14,240
this

424
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:17,960
and you will understand

425
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,960
in a little moment.

426
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:26,000
So while you are here, your other

427
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:31,600
incarnations live to in the past and in

428
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:36,640
the future because time is not linear.

429
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:39,600
You can communicate with them.

430
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:42,400
These are not different timelines.

431
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:44,320
No, there is only one and unique eternal

432
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:48,640
time

433
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:52,520
and it is not linear.

434
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:52,520
It is spherical.

435
00:26:56,159 --> 00:27:02,320
Time exists as a whole

436
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:07,360
at once.

437
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:10,000
The word time line exists only regarding

438
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:14,240
linear time.

439
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:17,440
When you are incarnated on a planet with

440
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:21,360
its rotation cycle,

441
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:24,400
its orbit around its star

442
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:29,200
and of course of its star around the

443
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:32,640
galactic center in 250 million years.

444
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:36,640
You experience time as linear when you

445
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:41,200
are bound by gravity.

446
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:45,799
You experience time as linear when you

447
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:45,799
are bound by gravity.

448
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:56,679
Time in the absolute is not a line.

449
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,679
It's a field.

450
00:27:56,799 --> 00:28:05,679
And there is only one

451
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:10,360
unique spherical time field

452
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:10,360
eternity in one moment.

453
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:20,240
Same

454
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:24,720
as there is only one infinite space.

455
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:27,679
Infinity in one space

456
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:31,880
and one infinite

457
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:31,880
creator consciousness.

458
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:40,240
The three

459
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:41,760
constants of the universe,

460
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:45,919
time,

461
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:48,799
space, consciousness,

462
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:51,799
eternity, infinity,

463
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:51,799
oneness,

464
00:28:52,000 --> 00:29:00,919
time, eternity, space, infinity,

465
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:00,919
consciousness, oneness.

466
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:08,200
This is creator. This is creation.

467
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:14,679
Are you right?

468
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:22,480
That is what incarn that is um what

469
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:24,559
incarnated beings subject to gravity.

470
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:27,520
That's why they have difficulty to

471
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:29,840
comprehend.

472
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:32,480
You need to extract your mind from

473
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:35,520
linear thinking. This happens when you

474
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:37,440
incarnate in a biometric as I said but

475
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:39,840
you know this you lose this

476
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:42,559
comprehension of time of this of the

477
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:46,960
time field because you switch into a

478
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:48,559
planetary linear time gravity orbital

479
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:50,720
time

480
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:53,520
orbital time.

481
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:55,440
But anyone is able to remember this. You

482
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:57,679
just have to snap out of gravitational

483
00:29:55,440 --> 00:30:00,960
time.

484
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:03,840
project your consciousness out of your

485
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:08,360
body

486
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:08,360
through meditation for instance.

487
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:20,720
I know it's hard to extract your mind

488
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:23,200
from linear gravity but you can do it.

489
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:26,480
Now listen,

490
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:29,360
all the incarnations you have lived

491
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:32,080
are existing

492
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:34,559
simultaneously in the universal time

493
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:37,799
field because there is no linear time in

494
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:37,799
the absolute

495
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:43,760
but you cannot access them or interact

496
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:47,240
with them as long as you are in gravity

497
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:47,240
linear time.

498
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:55,600
It also explains the confusion

499
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:59,200
as to why people sometimes

500
00:30:55,600 --> 00:31:01,840
believe that their soul is split into

501
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:05,279
different timelines

502
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:07,679
or other dimensional universes which is

503
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:11,240
an illusion.

504
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:11,240
It is a misperception.

505
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:18,880
linearity. The experience, the linear

506
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:24,279
linear experience of time

507
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:24,279
is um a perception,

508
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:33,480
not reality. It's a perception of

509
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:33,480
reality.

510
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:42,159
It would go against the natural laws of

511
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:45,760
creation to think that um a human soul

512
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:50,120
could split into subsouls to animate

513
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:50,120
different avatars at the same time.

514
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:58,000
This is not working.

515
00:31:54,880 --> 00:32:01,000
But you know you your consciousness is

516
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,000
one

517
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:10,320
You cannot be many of your yourself in

518
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:12,640
the same present in the same time. But

519
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:14,799
I'm going to talk about uh

520
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:20,080
reincarnations a little bit further.

521
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:21,840
First I need to to uh precise that um

522
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:23,760
splitting of consciousness can be done

523
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:25,360
artificially. It's against the laws of

524
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:27,840
the universe against the laws of

525
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:30,880
creation but it unfortunately can be

526
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:33,360
done uh by technology.

527
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:35,840
uh but it never happens in the natural

528
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:38,960
laws of creation but when it's done by

529
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:43,200
by technology I mean the person is

530
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:45,919
suffering a lot a lot it's it's torment

531
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:48,240
it's it's it's not natural

532
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:51,600
so when you meet yourself who lived and

533
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:54,399
died on another world hundreds of

534
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:57,039
thousands of years ago

535
00:32:54,399 --> 00:33:01,120
you meet yourself

536
00:32:57,039 --> 00:33:05,039
as you were then as a whole complete

537
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:08,720
soul being just same as you are now.

538
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:10,720
This is you but this is also you.

539
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:15,120
If you are in linear time you can say

540
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:18,559
this was me in a previous life

541
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:21,360
in the linearity of time. But if you are

542
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:24,080
in the time field, out of incarnation,

543
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:27,279
out of gravity, you say, "Oh, that's

544
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:32,240
another that's me."

545
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:35,200
That's just me in another incarnation.

546
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:37,760
That has already happened,

547
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:39,760
but that is still there,

548
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:44,000
still existing.

549
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:47,720
It's complicated, but it is like this.

550
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,720
So um

551
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:53,840
you meet yourself as a whole and you are

552
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:56,559
not a fraction of each other but you are

553
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:59,760
two separate complete whole individuals

554
00:33:56,559 --> 00:34:02,720
who are still the same person

555
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:05,720
regarding the spherical time field of

556
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:05,720
creation.

557
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:09,640
Our

558
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:19,040
soul journey is not as straight and uh

559
00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:21,599
simple as we first imagined. Right?

560
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:24,800
In fact, uh it is anything but a

561
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:28,440
straight line.

562
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:28,440
Our soul journey

563
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:36,480
is a winding multi-dimensional roller

564
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:41,320
coaster in a spherical time field.

565
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:41,320
We come from and are made of source.

566
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:47,280
You are the image of God. Yes. Not the

567
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:49,839
body, the consciousness.

568
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:53,520
But as soon as we detach from it, from

569
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:58,240
her, we begin the journey back to the

570
00:34:53,520 --> 00:35:01,520
source by experiencing everything there

571
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:05,240
is to experience in the creation field

572
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:05,240
of all existence.

573
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:10,040
And here you are.

574
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:18,560
You have woven family ties along the

575
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:21,560
way. Real true bonds that will last

576
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:21,560
forever.

577
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:30,000
You are

578
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:34,200
the only one of your kind

579
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,200
like everyone else is.

580
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:38,320
unique

581
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:41,359
linear

582
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:44,480
linear time is not a thing.

583
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:47,920
So all your incarnations coexist in the

584
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:50,920
same time field but there is only one

585
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:50,920
you.

586
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:59,520
The concept of multiple timelines is um

587
00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:02,800
it's false because a timeline is an

588
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:05,920
illusion, a perception, a distortion of

589
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:09,800
our perception of time related to our

590
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:09,800
experience of gravity.

591
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:17,839
Absolute time is a field

592
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:21,040
in which every second coexist at the

593
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:24,000
same time.

594
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:27,920
Imagine that field

595
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:30,720
composed with myriads of tiny dots and

596
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:33,040
they all exist at the same time. But

597
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:36,160
this dot may be you when you were living

598
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:38,560
in I don't know Atlantis. And this dot

599
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:42,880
may be you now. And this dot is you in

600
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:44,640
the future on Mars or wherever else.

601
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:49,400
But they all exist at the same time.

602
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:49,400
It's a field. Okay.

603
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:55,960
Time is a quantum field.

604
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:04,480
There is no linearity in the absolute

605
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:09,119
time quantum field.

606
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:12,440
Past, present, and future coexist in the

607
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:12,440
time field.

608
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:17,359
So, we're going to get in the heat of

609
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:19,440
the subject now because we're not yet

610
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:21,520
there.

611
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:25,200
What happens if we interact with the

612
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:28,200
past event and change the present?

613
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:28,200
Now

614
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:33,200
if you make a mistake in one incarnation

615
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:36,480
for instance and you want to come back

616
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:39,200
in a new incarnation to fix that mistake

617
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:40,880
there is a story line but this story

618
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:44,480
line

619
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:47,480
is called evolution

620
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:47,480
growth.

621
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:53,599
Understand evolution not as linear but

622
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:58,200
progressive.

623
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:58,200
Progressive doesn't always mean linear.

624
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:03,960
Linearity equals cycles,

625
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:10,200
not progressive progression.

626
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:15,520
Progression is a growing

627
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:18,400
dynamics.

628
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:23,240
It's evolution.

629
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:23,240
Linearity, it's gravity. It's cycles.

630
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:29,040
There's something called a Fibonacci

631
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:30,880
sequence. You know what it is? It's when

632
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:34,720
you take numbers and you add them to

633
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:36,160
each other. You add to the last number,

634
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:38,240
it gives you a number that you add to

635
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:42,320
the last number, etc., etc., etc. That's

636
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:46,000
a Fibonacci sequence. Well, this

637
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:49,280
is the mechanism of evolution.

638
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:52,280
The sequence of number is not linear but

639
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:52,280
progressive.

640
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:59,480
Progressive equals the spiral of

641
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:59,480
evolution.

642
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:06,720
The Fibonacci sequence

643
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:10,480
the is the golden mean.

644
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:12,480
These numbers are progressive

645
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:15,359
and progressive can be evolving an

646
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:19,040
evolving line, spiral, sphere, cube,

647
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:22,960
complex geometrical structure or plasmic

648
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:26,480
concept. Even progressive evolves as a

649
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:29,920
fractal of itself

650
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:32,079
as does creation through evolution. So

651
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:34,880
you have

652
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:38,079
so to resume a little bit you have this

653
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:40,880
structure the latice of the universe

654
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:42,880
that's the skeleton of creation

655
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:45,040
and

656
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:47,119
this is where everything is structures

657
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:49,839
structured.

658
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:52,960
Now you need a dynamics

659
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:54,800
to give an impulse to this to create the

660
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:58,640
fractals.

661
00:39:54,800 --> 00:40:00,960
It is the golden mean, the Fibonacci

662
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:03,200
sequence, the equation of progress,

663
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:06,160
evolution, the equation of evolution

664
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:09,440
from every point in that mesh in that

665
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:13,119
that grid

666
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:15,680
generates a fractal. A fractal that is

667
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:18,240
going to generate another fractal. And

668
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:20,240
this is growth.

669
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:22,880
Evolution. It's for matter. It works for

670
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:25,760
matter. It works for consciousness

671
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:25,760
also.

672
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:36,040
So

673
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:40,320
evolution

674
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:42,640
is

675
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:44,800
something that is always moving, always

676
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:47,839
dynamics and

677
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:51,520
it's a fractal. You know the Fibonacci

678
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:54,480
sequence is fractal

679
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:57,599
because not only it goes infinitely

680
00:40:54,480 --> 00:41:01,480
in the addition of it on itself but also

681
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:01,480
in goes to infinity

682
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:06,880
at the beginning. It never is it never

683
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:09,119
starts.

684
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:12,880
We start the Fibonacci sequence with

685
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:16,720
zero and then one. But before zero, it

686
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:20,800
winds the other the other direction

687
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:24,839
to the infinitely small.

688
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:24,839
It's a constant flow.

689
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:33,680
So

690
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:35,520
linear equal linearity equals cycles.

691
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:36,800
Progressive equals the spiral of

692
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:39,119
evolution.

693
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:40,880
So if we go back in time to change the

694
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:43,920
past,

695
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:46,000
we change the present.

696
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:48,240
This is a fact. You are in this quantum

697
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,800
field.

698
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:54,400
If you everything is interconnected, you

699
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:56,319
have all your own interconnected dots.

700
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:59,359
Your story, your journey, your

701
00:41:56,319 --> 00:42:02,480
experience is a mesh of dots. One dot

702
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:04,960
what quantum dots if you tingle it it's

703
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:07,839
going to influence another one that is

704
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:10,960
built from it. The present is built from

705
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:13,520
your actual present dot. Present is

706
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:16,240
moving all the time but

707
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:21,839
it's influenced by what just happened

708
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:24,400
and what this other past event

709
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:26,400
what it occurred in that that influenced

710
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:29,359
that made the present as it is today. So

711
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:32,400
if you tingle this little past dot, it

712
00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:36,319
will um influence of course this one

713
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:40,680
will change. That's quantum entanglement

714
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:40,680
works with time as well. Okay.

715
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:46,640
So we go back in in the past, we change

716
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:48,480
the present not because of linearity of

717
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:51,480
time but because time is a quantum

718
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:51,480
field.

719
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:58,880
But is this action considered as an

720
00:42:55,839 --> 00:43:01,520
update of the present? And where does

721
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:03,920
the old paradigm go?

722
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:06,400
I mean, you change something and the

723
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:08,880
present

724
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:13,240
changes. It's different now, but the old

725
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:13,240
present where it is.

726
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:20,920
Well, time also has its prime directive.

727
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:28,319
And you know the prime directive is

728
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:29,920
based on the universal law. I've said it

729
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:32,079
enough. The prime directive of the

730
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:35,920
Galactic Federation of Worlds as well as

731
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:39,200
the the Anarch Dakura are based on the

732
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:42,400
laws of the universe.

733
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:44,640
And it's exactly the same for time for

734
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:46,640
non-inference

735
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:49,040
not to disrupt the balance of the

736
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:52,040
creation.

737
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:52,040
This

738
00:43:56,079 --> 00:44:02,640
the time field the quantum time field

739
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:05,040
has security security locks.

740
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:07,440
It's you cannot just change the past

741
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:10,400
like this. To change the present you

742
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:12,960
must physically

743
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:15,520
physically

744
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:17,280
interfere with the past. Why physically

745
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:19,599
and not just through consciousness

746
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:23,920
interface? because you need to have an

747
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:28,800
effect on the the the holographic matrix

748
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:31,280
of that point physical interface

749
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:34,079
to change this one.

750
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:37,680
It's it's a question of um atomic

751
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:41,359
vibration frequency. You need to modify

752
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:43,680
the frequency of vibration of certain um

753
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:48,240
elements of this

754
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:51,200
um matrix in the past to and by

755
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:54,480
entanglement change the present if you

756
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:56,240
want. It's it's easier to modify the

757
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:57,920
matrix in the present. I can tell you

758
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:59,920
you don't need to go back in time. You

759
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:03,119
have the power to change the reality

760
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:06,800
now. Do not try to change it from the

761
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:10,319
past. We have this power. The human have

762
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:13,960
this power to change the present the

763
00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:13,960
matrix of reality.

764
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:23,000
I'm just checking the chat now to see

765
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:23,000
everything. Yes, you hear me well. So

766
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:28,359
time field has security locks

767
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:34,720
by only

768
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:39,240
being able to modify, alter

769
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:39,240
or interfere physically.

770
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:47,040
Only solid interference can affect time.

771
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:49,920
That is why people are sent back in time

772
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:51,839
to modify an event. They cannot do it by

773
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:54,160
consciousness connecting with the person

774
00:45:51,839 --> 00:45:57,040
in the past. I'll develop that in in a

775
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:59,680
in a little moment shortly.

776
00:45:57,040 --> 00:46:01,920
So to alter a timeline, you need um an

777
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:05,599
anchor point

778
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:06,960
in that timeline. Timeline I mean we you

779
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:08,960
understand what I mean. It's not a

780
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:10,880
timeline but it's better to understand

781
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:14,960
with these words. You need an anchor

782
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:18,160
point that will be the vector

783
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:20,560
to physically alter time. You need

784
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:23,920
technology because you need to travel

785
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:26,240
back in time physically. You need time

786
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:27,920
machines of some sort of or time

787
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:30,079
portals.

788
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:31,839
This is crucial for the understanding of

789
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:33,760
time.

790
00:46:31,839 --> 00:46:36,640
In a medbed, for instance, when you want

791
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:39,280
to regress a body to a healthier state,

792
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:42,079
you're going to act physically on it on

793
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:43,920
the holographic on the holographic um

794
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:45,520
structure

795
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:48,800
of this this body. And you use

796
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:48,800
technology for that.

797
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:53,920
You can also use crystals, but that's a

798
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:57,440
little bit complex and it's still

799
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:59,599
technology anyway. So, you can interface

800
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:03,119
with your consciousness, your own

801
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:04,960
consciousness in another on another dot,

802
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:07,520
entangled dot, communicating with

803
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:10,240
yourself incarnated in the past or in

804
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:13,040
the future because you are of the same

805
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:16,480
frequency. It's you. But this will

806
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:20,720
remain as a communication in the higher

807
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:24,319
vibrational plane of your consciousness.

808
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:26,960
Maybe it will be experienced as a dream

809
00:47:24,319 --> 00:47:30,800
for instance for example.

810
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:36,240
But to create an interaction

811
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:38,240
with actually an event in the past and

812
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:40,880
alter it.

813
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:42,319
You need to an anchor. I mean a physical

814
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:45,359
anchor.

815
00:47:42,319 --> 00:47:50,359
You need to be there physically.

816
00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:50,359
Time travel. Physical time travel.

817
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:56,960
What if I tune into the higher frequency

818
00:47:54,319 --> 00:48:02,480
of my eternal consciousness? Because we

819
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:04,800
are eternal. The time field is eternal.

820
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:07,119
No beginning, no end. It's not linear

821
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:11,760
beginning and end.

822
00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:13,839
It's vocabulary for linear thinking. So

823
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:18,079
I tune into the higher frequency or my

824
00:48:13,839 --> 00:48:19,760
higher self and I tap into the time when

825
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:22,559
um

826
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:24,800
um I want to connect with my higher self

827
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:27,839
at the time when I was incarnating I

828
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:30,319
incarnated for instance um during the

829
00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:33,359
French middle age let's say so I'm going

830
00:48:30,319 --> 00:48:36,400
to tap into the time field to that dot

831
00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:40,240
and I want to entangle

832
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:42,960
to that dot to interfere with interact

833
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:45,839
with it.

834
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:48,240
So I'm here and I see myself in the

835
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:51,599
French middle age for instance. Well, we

836
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:55,119
can have any type of conversation.

837
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:56,880
But if I say to her, hey on this day

838
00:48:55,119 --> 00:48:58,800
someone is going to assassinate the

839
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:01,760
king.

840
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:06,400
The only thing that um will happen is

841
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:09,760
that my medieval self can feel a kind of

842
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:12,640
intuition or think that she dreamt

843
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:15,440
vaguely of the king being assassinated,

844
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:20,160
but she won't truly do anything about

845
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:22,960
it. Nothing will happen.

846
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:25,520
And that's in the best of conditions.

847
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:27,839
Most of the time

848
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:29,599
it doesn't interfere at all. You're

849
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:32,599
talking from a higher self to a higher

850
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:32,599
self.

851
00:49:33,359 --> 00:49:39,520
What if now I travel to the past

852
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:41,839
physically with a time travel machine or

853
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:43,920
portal and I meet my medieval self and I

854
00:49:41,839 --> 00:49:46,240
tell her, "Hey, on this day someone is

855
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:48,480
going to assassinate the king. So try to

856
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:50,400
prevent it."

857
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:54,800
Then

858
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:57,119
that is physical alteration

859
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:59,760
of the three-dimensional hologram of

860
00:49:57,119 --> 00:50:05,400
reality,

861
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:05,400
time, space, consciousness.

862
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:18,359
On that day, my old self will save that

863
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:18,359
king and change the course of history.

864
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:24,720
Now what's going to happen?

865
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:29,720
What happens then to the old story when

866
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:29,720
that king is dead? Where has it gone?

867
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:35,760
Is it erased as if it never existed?

868
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:38,640
Is the old future be erased or it

869
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:40,640
continues to live somewhere?

870
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:44,400
Well,

871
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:47,400
it goes nowhere because it is stopped,

872
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:47,400
deconstructed.

873
00:50:47,599 --> 00:50:52,480
When you modify something in the time

874
00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:56,160
field, you don't create a split of

875
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:59,440
reality. You replace, you reattune. It's

876
00:50:56,160 --> 00:51:01,280
all about vibrations and frequencies.

877
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:04,640
You rearrange

878
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:08,079
this little quantum dot

879
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:12,000
that's called me in the medieval times

880
00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:13,680
in France. you rearrange it's the the

881
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:16,800
configuration

882
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:18,800
of your life and that's going to affect

883
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:22,319
other little dots that are connected to

884
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:24,400
this event the king dying etc but it

885
00:51:22,319 --> 00:51:27,359
will replace things will be replaced

886
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:29,839
there is no split of reality because it

887
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:31,440
will be chaos

888
00:51:29,839 --> 00:51:34,440
and that's not how the universe

889
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:34,440
functions

890
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:39,119
vap vaporized

891
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:41,440
many people believe that it creates It's

892
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:44,319
um a parallel timeline but it is a

893
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:46,160
misconception.

894
00:51:44,319 --> 00:51:51,359
Why?

895
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:55,839
Because time is not linear.

896
00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:58,480
Timelines is a perception not a thing.

897
00:51:55,839 --> 00:52:01,200
If it were, it would create a parallel

898
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:03,680
timeline or parallel universe suddenly.

899
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:06,480
But your own universe,

900
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:08,480
what is that? It's all illusion. It's

901
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:11,760
not real.

902
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:15,200
It's not like a Y junction, you know.

903
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:20,520
It's not real. Things are staying

904
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:20,520
unique. They just change.

905
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:24,200
Evolution.

906
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:29,839
That's evolution.

907
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:34,800
Timelines

908
00:52:29,839 --> 00:52:39,880
are an experience of reality

909
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:39,880
of a reality that is not linear.

910
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:44,559
Linearity as I said is experience when

911
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:47,839
consciousness entangles with gravity.

912
00:52:44,559 --> 00:52:49,920
Time is a unified field. So what happens

913
00:52:47,839 --> 00:52:53,280
then?

914
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:55,119
It generates what we call a local

915
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:58,000
paradigma.

916
00:52:55,119 --> 00:53:01,920
The present is changed

917
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:05,599
and the old paradigm is deconstructed.

918
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:07,280
It just ends, ceased to exist.

919
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:09,760
The story when the king dies is

920
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:11,680
terminated.

921
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:13,760
The murderer will never sit on the

922
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:17,200
throne.

923
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:19,839
This changes is of course local as

924
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:23,800
altering only the events and beings

925
00:53:19,839 --> 00:53:23,800
affected by this change.

926
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:31,520
It can have a huge collateral effect

927
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:33,440
such as changing the destiny of a

928
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:35,839
country or even a planet, a galaxy for

929
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:40,880
instance, or a tiny one such as when you

930
00:53:35,839 --> 00:53:45,240
change your mind about killing a fly.

931
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:45,240
If someone travels to the past,

932
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:51,920
are you still following? Because it's a

933
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:56,440
lot of things. How is everybody doing?

934
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:56,440
I'm just looking at the chat.

935
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:04,400
Yes, the universe stands to perfection.

936
00:54:00,079 --> 00:54:06,640
Kasmican just uh mentioned Jen Han.

937
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:09,520
Yes, you're still there. Okay, not

938
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:13,720
crying yet.

939
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:13,720
Okay, let's let's go ahead.

940
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:23,200
So um now

941
00:54:20,079 --> 00:54:25,520
another time paradox story that is very

942
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:28,800
known. Um,

943
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:34,480
if someone travels to the past where and

944
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:37,359
when my mother meets my father.

945
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:42,040
Yes, I'm going there. And changes that

946
00:54:37,359 --> 00:54:42,040
event, will I vaporize?

947
00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:47,760
Answer.

948
00:54:44,319 --> 00:54:50,559
The ancient story when you are born

949
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:52,240
ceases to exist.

950
00:54:50,559 --> 00:54:54,079
Remember you modify this. This one

951
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:56,319
changes.

952
00:54:54,079 --> 00:54:58,960
You cease to exist. Yes, you vaporize.

953
00:54:56,319 --> 00:55:01,359
You cease to exist in the new present.

954
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:03,440
But it's not you vaporizing in in the

955
00:55:01,359 --> 00:55:05,920
same present.

956
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:08,079
The law it's local paradigm. Everything

957
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:12,079
that will have been linked to you

958
00:55:08,079 --> 00:55:14,960
existing will have changed also.

959
00:55:12,079 --> 00:55:17,040
Sometimes it can go very far. So you're

960
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:22,880
not here anymore. There's a new present

961
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:24,960
with you not here. the same present but

962
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:27,920
the local there's a local paradigm that

963
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:30,960
will have been diff different a

964
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:33,599
different local paradigm

965
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:35,200
you cease to exist in the new present

966
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:36,960
considering that the present doesn't

967
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:41,839
exist

968
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:45,119
as such as you knew it time is a flow

969
00:55:41,839 --> 00:55:48,799
a current in the field

970
00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:50,880
not linear the connection between That

971
00:55:48,799 --> 00:55:53,760
alteration of an event in the past and

972
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:56,880
the current moment is not a linear

973
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:59,280
connection but a quantum entanglement.

974
00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:02,799
So you

975
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:04,799
if you suddenly are not born, you're not

976
00:56:02,799 --> 00:56:08,559
here. Your consciousness is somewhere

977
00:56:04,799 --> 00:56:12,520
else but the body this life is not here

978
00:56:08,559 --> 00:56:12,520
anymore. Okay?

979
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:20,400
That's when there's been a physical

980
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:23,200
interaction that breaks infringes the

981
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:25,920
universal laws. Okay?

982
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:27,760
Because the universe doesn't like this.

983
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:32,000
Creator doesn't like this. It's not

984
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:34,480
natural. Okay? That's experiment

985
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:37,880
between technologized beings who want to

986
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:37,880
play with that.

987
00:56:41,119 --> 00:56:47,920
So time

988
00:56:43,839 --> 00:56:50,480
as as an infinite field is composed of

989
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:53,119
flowing data

990
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:55,200
and electrical neur neuronal

991
00:56:53,119 --> 00:56:59,520
connections.

992
00:56:55,200 --> 00:57:02,240
The flow of time is not linear but all

993
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:06,000
pervading. It's all alive and conscious.

994
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:08,319
Imagine a big brain,

995
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:10,559
big mind. It's a mind. It's alive and

996
00:57:08,319 --> 00:57:15,720
conscious. That's time

997
00:57:10,559 --> 00:57:15,720
and also space and also consciousness.

998
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:25,839
Um, now

999
00:57:23,599 --> 00:57:31,079
there's a question

1000
00:57:25,839 --> 00:57:31,079
um I've been asked a lot.

1001
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:37,720
Going to have a bit of water. Tea

1002
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:37,720
actually.

1003
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:46,359
So question that many of you are asking

1004
00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:53,359
when

1005
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:56,799
no I am my last incarnation was on

1006
00:57:53,359 --> 00:58:02,799
planet era in the pleades. I chose to

1007
00:57:56,799 --> 00:58:04,880
undergo the the the program not as dying

1008
00:58:02,799 --> 00:58:07,920
and incarnating but as leaving my body

1009
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:10,480
in stasis to come to earth. Why did I do

1010
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:12,720
that? Because era is not my planetary

1011
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:14,640
biometrics.

1012
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:17,200
I have

1013
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:20,000
chosen to live on era as a choice to

1014
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:24,720
experience something but I'm not from

1015
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:28,559
era. So I'm not part of the the De'Ra

1016
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:31,760
biometrics. Okay, my biometrics it's a

1017
00:58:28,559 --> 00:58:33,920
Maria in the Alia star system in the

1018
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:38,240
Alderon galaxy 45 million years from

1019
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:41,119
here. So it was easier for me to just go

1020
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:46,480
on a pod

1021
00:58:41,119 --> 00:58:49,200
and um so when I come back to error

1022
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:52,400
I will reintegrate my body in stasis.

1023
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:54,319
Okay, that's for a fact.

1024
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:57,920
I'm talking about me, but that's the

1025
00:58:54,319 --> 00:59:00,000
case of millions of star seeds. So,

1026
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:03,920
because we have changed the timeline of

1027
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:06,960
this galaxy now, it's done,

1028
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:09,520
which is on the gravity linear time.

1029
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:13,079
Okay, the galaxy and the dark future has

1030
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:13,079
ceased to exist.

1031
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:18,640
There is a different future now that is

1032
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:23,319
already there.

1033
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:23,319
300 years later on era

1034
00:59:23,599 --> 00:59:28,799
the envoy program

1035
00:59:26,559 --> 00:59:30,880
never existed.

1036
00:59:28,799 --> 00:59:34,000
So we could say

1037
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:38,079
because there was no need for it because

1038
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:39,839
the dark timeline never existed.

1039
00:59:38,079 --> 00:59:42,240
So I could say I do not have a body in

1040
00:59:39,839 --> 00:59:44,799
stasis.

1041
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:46,720
What will happen? Is that a time

1042
00:59:44,799 --> 00:59:50,160
paradox?

1043
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:52,640
Well, do you think that the people who

1044
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:55,880
created the envoy programs didn't think

1045
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:55,880
about that?

1046
00:59:56,160 --> 01:00:01,920
Everyone comes home safely, but home

1047
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:05,880
will be a different place. Let me

1048
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:05,880
explain this to you.

1049
01:00:06,799 --> 01:00:13,200
The body in stasis

1050
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:19,799
as the buildings where they are they are

1051
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:19,799
secured in a time distortion hull.

1052
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:25,280
This means that you will safely

1053
01:00:21,839 --> 01:00:28,160
reintegrate your stasis body.

1054
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:30,240
But in a world that has changed. The

1055
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:32,559
whole building is a time traveling

1056
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:35,760
machine. The whole pod even sometimes

1057
01:00:32,559 --> 01:00:37,839
depends where your pod is. The pods are

1058
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:40,720
time traveling machines. They are in a

1059
01:00:37,839 --> 01:00:42,799
distortion hull. You will be a time

1060
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:47,319
traveler who has landed in a new

1061
01:00:42,799 --> 01:00:47,319
environment with different parameters.

1062
01:00:48,079 --> 01:00:57,319
You know after all it is only the

1063
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:57,319
equivalent of 300 years

1064
01:00:58,079 --> 01:01:03,359
which is not even a generation for the

1065
01:01:00,319 --> 01:01:05,440
people on era.

1066
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:10,119
The parents

1067
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:10,119
of the time traveler are still alive.

1068
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:16,960
We are on era time. 300 years on era

1069
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:19,359
time

1070
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:22,640
in some places where the change has

1071
01:01:19,359 --> 01:01:25,040
hasn't affected that much.

1072
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:28,640
Everything will seem normal

1073
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:31,119
to some of the envoys returning home.

1074
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:33,040
It will be like waking up from from a

1075
01:01:31,119 --> 01:01:35,520
dream and they will find their family

1076
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:37,920
waiting for them.

1077
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:41,200
While some envoys will return to a world

1078
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:43,520
where the impact is greater and then

1079
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:46,400
they may not find a people they they

1080
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:50,799
know or they may find people who didn't

1081
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:54,520
even die in a war that never existed.

1082
01:01:50,799 --> 01:01:54,520
That's the good part.

1083
01:01:55,119 --> 01:01:59,839
This was the contract. You all were

1084
01:01:57,680 --> 01:02:01,440
aware of these conditions before you

1085
01:01:59,839 --> 01:02:03,920
accepted.

1086
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:07,319
You knew the risks not to see your

1087
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:07,319
family again.

1088
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:12,799
And what about the rest of the

1089
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:14,960
Federation troops who didn't participate

1090
01:02:12,799 --> 01:02:17,680
in the envoy program? Those who have

1091
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:20,799
physically traveled back in time to

1092
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:22,880
alter its course,

1093
01:02:20,799 --> 01:02:24,559
responding the call of the the Zen

1094
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:26,480
Zenate.

1095
01:02:24,559 --> 01:02:29,680
Well, these ones they remain physically

1096
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:33,960
in the new version of time 300 years

1097
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:33,960
earlier than when they left

1098
01:02:34,319 --> 01:02:41,760
because they are still in the past

1099
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:44,000
now and here. Thoran is still in his

1100
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:47,559
past here

1101
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:47,559
as I am.

1102
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:53,040
They jumped out of the old version of

1103
01:02:49,839 --> 01:02:56,880
time to become time travelers.

1104
01:02:53,040 --> 01:02:59,040
Okay, they got here v via time traveling

1105
01:02:56,880 --> 01:03:02,400
technology.

1106
01:02:59,040 --> 01:03:06,240
So we can consider they traveled in a

1107
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:11,040
time distortion technology when they go

1108
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:15,039
back now 300 years earth years. No not

1109
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:19,039
earth years sorry 300 years era years

1110
01:03:15,039 --> 01:03:21,119
era years into the future. They will be

1111
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:23,200
like the envoys

1112
01:03:21,119 --> 01:03:27,520
time travelers returning home after

1113
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:29,680
escaping the time paradox. You know

1114
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:33,520
the curators of the envoy programs will

1115
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:35,200
have made sure that all the data is

1116
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:37,920
secure

1117
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:43,000
that those remained on the home world

1118
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:43,000
know who we are and what we have done.

1119
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:50,640
It's only 300 years

1120
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:54,559
in era time,

1121
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:58,200
you know, give or take 20 years of

1122
01:03:54,559 --> 01:03:58,200
earth time scale

1123
01:03:58,799 --> 01:04:04,000
in comparison in

1124
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:05,520
correspondence.

1125
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:10,880
It's very exciting to go back and

1126
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:13,200
discover what our worlds have become.

1127
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:19,000
and many of them have already gone back

1128
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:19,000
home. So now there's a thing

1129
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:26,640
300 years on era is equivalent to 20

1130
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:29,280
years on earth.

1131
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:32,160
So one year

1132
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:38,440
one earth year

1133
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:38,440
is the equivalent of 15 era years.

1134
01:04:39,839 --> 01:04:46,400
Take into account the orbital speed of

1135
01:04:42,319 --> 01:04:48,880
era around Ashara its star TEA combined

1136
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:52,640
with the fact that the entire galaxy is

1137
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:54,720
on the fifth density orbital time as a

1138
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:57,520
standard followed by the galactic

1139
01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:59,039
alliance and that is important fifth

1140
01:04:57,520 --> 01:05:01,039
density

1141
01:04:59,039 --> 01:05:02,960
time

1142
01:05:01,039 --> 01:05:05,760
that's the

1143
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:09,280
the the the balance time of the galaxy

1144
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:12,480
Nataru is on fifth density in average

1145
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:15,839
And they're above and below. But the

1146
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:18,400
fifth density is the the the the matrix

1147
01:05:15,839 --> 01:05:20,319
the most important is a prominent

1148
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:24,200
density of the galaxy. That's where

1149
01:05:20,319 --> 01:05:24,200
everything is happening.

1150
01:05:24,559 --> 01:05:29,119
So

1151
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:32,160
there is another universal law. The

1152
01:05:29,119 --> 01:05:35,559
higher the density is, the faster time

1153
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:35,559
is experienced.

1154
01:05:36,799 --> 01:05:43,440
Because when the particles of matter

1155
01:05:40,079 --> 01:05:45,119
vibrate at a faster rate or at a higher

1156
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:47,839
frequency if you want to call it like

1157
01:05:45,119 --> 01:05:50,480
this

1158
01:05:47,839 --> 01:05:53,520
time is experienced

1159
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:56,640
faster. Time is not faster. Time is

1160
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:59,359
time. It's a quantum field. But it it's

1161
01:05:56,640 --> 01:06:03,039
the experience that we have of it

1162
01:05:59,359 --> 01:06:07,200
regarding to regarding our density that

1163
01:06:03,039 --> 01:06:10,559
seems as that is perceived as faster or

1164
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:15,799
slower because the the particles of our

1165
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:15,799
bodies are vibrating faster or slower.

1166
01:06:16,559 --> 01:06:23,520
Have you noticed this already? Yes.

1167
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:26,240
Time seems to flow faster than when you

1168
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:28,799
were a kid, right?

1169
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:31,839
Well, it's because Earth is shifting

1170
01:06:28,799 --> 01:06:34,839
progressively into a faster density of

1171
01:06:31,839 --> 01:06:34,839
matter.

1172
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:42,319
Have you ever wondered why happy moments

1173
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:44,559
seem to flow faster than sad moments?

1174
01:06:42,319 --> 01:06:48,000
Of course, happiness is a higher

1175
01:06:44,559 --> 01:06:50,640
frequency than sadness.

1176
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:52,559
So, it is experienced

1177
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:55,559
faster when we are in the frequency of

1178
01:06:52,559 --> 01:06:55,559
happiness.

1179
01:06:57,200 --> 01:07:02,640
But all this it's only the way time is

1180
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:05,839
experienced. It is not what absolute

1181
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:08,160
time is really. To experience the time

1182
01:07:05,839 --> 01:07:10,640
field as you say as I said you need to

1183
01:07:08,160 --> 01:07:14,760
uh step out of gravity

1184
01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:14,760
out of material linearity.

1185
01:07:15,039 --> 01:07:21,119
So um

1186
01:07:17,359 --> 01:07:24,400
earth is on the third density time.

1187
01:07:21,119 --> 01:07:27,680
It rotates slower transiting. Okay, it

1188
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:29,920
rotates slower than error

1189
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:33,280
and that is on in on the fifth density

1190
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:35,760
time. Okay, faster time.

1191
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:39,640
Universal time is the same. It is just

1192
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:39,640
experienced differently.

1193
01:07:41,039 --> 01:07:45,680
Make sense? Well, it's not over.

1194
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:48,680
Something else coming. Here's something

1195
01:07:45,680 --> 01:07:48,680
else.

1196
01:07:49,839 --> 01:07:53,319
What if we

1197
01:07:55,599 --> 01:08:02,480
what if we would talk about

1198
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:06,200
the dark fleet paradigm?

1199
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:06,200
Oh, what is that?

1200
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:14,400
Remember 300 years they they came the

1201
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:18,159
federation came from 300 years in the

1202
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:22,400
future to here. But 300 years on the

1203
01:08:18,159 --> 01:08:26,480
galactic time scale,

1204
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:29,359
fifth density on earth is

1205
01:08:26,480 --> 01:08:32,000
20 years.

1206
01:08:29,359 --> 01:08:34,560
Okay. In the third density,

1207
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:37,560
it's slower time.

1208
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:37,560
Yeah.

1209
01:08:37,839 --> 01:08:43,040
300 years. When the Andromedan Council

1210
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:45,679
asked the Galactic Alliance to send

1211
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:49,719
troops back in time, it was 300 years on

1212
01:08:45,679 --> 01:08:49,719
the galactic time.

1213
01:08:50,239 --> 01:08:56,719
Everywhere, everyone is

1214
01:08:53,199 --> 01:09:00,719
uh counting on this galactic orbital

1215
01:08:56,719 --> 01:09:04,239
time, fifth density.

1216
01:09:00,719 --> 01:09:09,440
That's the norm. So, the dark fleet were

1217
01:09:04,239 --> 01:09:11,600
a galactic threat already 20 years ago.

1218
01:09:09,440 --> 01:09:14,960
So

1219
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:16,880
in earth time frame 20 years make more

1220
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:18,880
sense because earth is in the third

1221
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:20,880
density.

1222
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:25,120
It makes 30 years for the fifth density

1223
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:26,719
people. If we don't need to we must not

1224
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:30,520
try to fit this on the linear time.

1225
01:09:26,719 --> 01:09:30,520
Okay. Okay.

1226
01:09:33,359 --> 01:09:38,319
While 300 years pass, you understand in

1227
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:40,480
the galactic time few density 20 years

1228
01:09:38,319 --> 01:09:43,199
pass on earth. The change in the

1229
01:09:40,480 --> 01:09:45,359
parameters of the ancient timeline where

1230
01:09:43,199 --> 01:09:47,759
the dark fleet would have taken over the

1231
01:09:45,359 --> 01:09:50,400
galaxy

1232
01:09:47,759 --> 01:09:55,040
was achieved and stabilized recently in

1233
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:58,239
early 2022 in Earthtime reference

1234
01:09:55,040 --> 01:10:00,800
only months before the time portal

1235
01:09:58,239 --> 01:10:02,640
window would close. I'm going to talk

1236
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:05,640
about that.

1237
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:05,640
So

1238
01:10:05,679 --> 01:10:11,840
I really want to insist in that. Forgive

1239
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:14,400
me for those who get it, who got it for

1240
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:16,480
the first time. But it needs to be

1241
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:18,800
really clear because that is the key to

1242
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:21,840
understand everything else that's

1243
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:24,840
coming, especially the secret space

1244
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:24,840
programs

1245
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:31,040
on the galactic time scale, 300 years in

1246
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:33,360
the future. On the galactic time scale,

1247
01:10:31,040 --> 01:10:35,040
the Andromedan say, "Hey, 300 years in

1248
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:37,600
the past,

1249
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:40,640
the dark fleet was about to sign an

1250
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:44,159
agreement something and we need to stop

1251
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:46,480
that. So go back 300 years in the past."

1252
01:10:44,159 --> 01:10:51,120
But when that happened,

1253
01:10:46,480 --> 01:10:54,239
it was 20 years in the past if we take

1254
01:10:51,120 --> 01:10:58,120
in account Earth time, third density

1255
01:10:54,239 --> 01:10:58,120
time. So that's important.

1256
01:10:59,040 --> 01:11:05,320
experience 300 for them. Experience two

1257
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:05,320
20 here.

1258
01:11:07,040 --> 01:11:10,040
So

1259
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:18,159
the the stabilization of the ancient

1260
01:11:15,440 --> 01:11:21,120
uh the new timeline I mean I don't like

1261
01:11:18,159 --> 01:11:24,080
to say timeline but the new parading was

1262
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:27,679
achieved and stabilized recently in 2022

1263
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:32,679
December earth time only month before

1264
01:11:27,679 --> 01:11:32,679
the time portal window would close

1265
01:11:33,040 --> 01:11:38,320
we had to go back to the source to earth

1266
01:11:36,239 --> 01:11:40,640
at the moment moment when the dark fleet

1267
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:44,239
would sign a great power sharing

1268
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:47,600
alliance with the Nebu Empire and rule

1269
01:11:44,239 --> 01:11:48,960
Nataru despicably.

1270
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:51,960
It would have been game over for

1271
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:51,960
everyone.

1272
01:11:54,239 --> 01:12:02,239
Thanks to the Zenate,

1273
01:11:57,440 --> 01:12:04,320
the exact time paradigm key was located.

1274
01:12:02,239 --> 01:12:09,520
It was a time window on Earth that was

1275
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:13,280
very narrow. a gap of five years

1276
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:18,360
from December 21st, 2027

1277
01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:18,360
to December 21st, 2022.

1278
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:26,560
The 21st of December are solstice dates

1279
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:30,000
for Earth. It's a gravitational

1280
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:33,840
geoposition that allows time portals to

1281
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:36,159
be open or closed.

1282
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:38,960
The mission was to destroy the Nebu at

1283
01:12:36,159 --> 01:12:41,199
the same time, kick the dark fleet

1284
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:43,520
mother faction of the star system and

1285
01:12:41,199 --> 01:12:45,760
the galactic alliance.

1286
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:48,480
You know, they didn't have the the

1287
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:51,600
resource to fight a global war against

1288
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:54,000
the dark fleet and the allied neu allies

1289
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:56,960
Nebu and their allies seek everyone at

1290
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:59,600
the same time. Elements of the equation

1291
01:12:56,960 --> 01:13:02,080
had to be taken down

1292
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:04,320
to weaken the equation.

1293
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:07,760
So to prevent this dramatic alliance

1294
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:10,000
between the dark fleet and the nebu to

1295
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:13,040
happen, it was easier to neutralize the

1296
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:15,760
nebu ruse. You can't fight the whole

1297
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:17,600
army composed of sikar nebu dark fleet

1298
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:20,080
to ally together because that's what

1299
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:22,000
they were about to do. Well, dark and

1300
01:13:20,080 --> 01:13:24,320
sikar was already together, but they had

1301
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:27,520
they were about to merge with the nebu

1302
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:29,520
which was big thing. So you you take

1303
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:31,440
down one.

1304
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:34,000
The easiest was the Nebu because they

1305
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:37,520
had a weak point, their queen. They took

1306
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:39,679
the queen thanks to Netor. And now, you

1307
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:42,000
know, it was easier to attack them. Then

1308
01:13:39,679 --> 01:13:44,719
they removed the dark fleet from the

1309
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:46,880
star system. Then they could not sign

1310
01:13:44,719 --> 01:13:50,239
any more disagreement there because at

1311
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:51,760
the same time the Nebu were uh

1312
01:13:50,239 --> 01:13:55,040
destroyed.

1313
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:58,199
You're never cautious enough. So that

1314
01:13:55,040 --> 01:13:58,199
was it.

1315
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:07,679
These were the worst years

1316
01:14:03,199 --> 01:14:10,000
in this ruth ruthless temporal war.

1317
01:14:07,679 --> 01:14:14,480
The job was done before the December

1318
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:19,800
21st, 2022 time portal closed.

1319
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:19,800
And the temporal war was won.

1320
01:14:22,159 --> 01:14:25,800
Everybody's there.

1321
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:32,239
So

1322
01:14:28,719 --> 01:14:34,719
20 years in the third density

1323
01:14:32,239 --> 01:14:38,640
is why the secret space programs are

1324
01:14:34,719 --> 01:14:42,719
based on a 20 years maximum schedule

1325
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:45,440
because after December 2022

1326
01:14:42,719 --> 01:14:47,679
the timeline changes

1327
01:14:45,440 --> 01:14:49,440
and they cannot go beyond that it

1328
01:14:47,679 --> 01:14:51,760
changes. They cannot go beyond that

1329
01:14:49,440 --> 01:14:54,640
further in time because it disappeared.

1330
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:57,640
It's disconstructed. It stops. It's

1331
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:57,640
non-existent.

1332
01:14:59,040 --> 01:15:04,679
It has merged into the new future, the

1333
01:15:01,440 --> 01:15:04,679
new timeline

1334
01:15:05,040 --> 01:15:10,800
and there's no point of no return.

1335
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:12,640
There's no point of return. I mean, this

1336
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:14,400
is why all the dark secret space

1337
01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:17,520
programs associated with the dark fleet

1338
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:21,520
and their acolytes in the dark military

1339
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:24,480
programs that we call the 20 and back

1340
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:28,080
that were created 20 or more years ago

1341
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:30,480
all ended before 2022

1342
01:15:28,080 --> 01:15:33,679
because the timeline changed and

1343
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:36,239
stabilized at that exact moment.

1344
01:15:33,679 --> 01:15:40,800
There was no way back from that point.

1345
01:15:36,239 --> 01:15:40,800
It had become a temporal dead end.

1346
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:48,480
So what happened to the people who did

1347
01:15:43,440 --> 01:15:50,880
more than 120 and back program? Well,

1348
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:54,320
those who began service early were able

1349
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:56,640
to do successive shifts

1350
01:15:54,320 --> 01:16:00,000
before 2022.

1351
01:15:56,640 --> 01:16:03,199
Others who began later served under the

1352
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:05,280
same limitation of the December 2022

1353
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:07,840
time collapse.

1354
01:16:05,280 --> 01:16:11,280
For these it resulted in multiple

1355
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:14,159
versions of themselves or altars

1356
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:17,679
which they sometimes mistakenly uh

1357
01:16:14,159 --> 01:16:19,679
identified as clones.

1358
01:16:17,679 --> 01:16:22,480
Although they were real cloning programs

1359
01:16:19,679 --> 01:16:26,080
but you know you understand they they

1360
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:28,000
did several those who did several 20 and

1361
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:31,520
back programs.

1362
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:35,159
It was done before 2022. That was the

1363
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:35,159
the the wall.

1364
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:42,400
So they they were it's like the quantum

1365
01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:45,600
field.

1366
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:49,600
You are meeting someone. Okay. So I

1367
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:52,560
bought these things for something.

1368
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:54,480
I'm going to use them.

1369
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:57,760
I went to the trouble to buy this and

1370
01:16:54,480 --> 01:17:02,600
and buy marker pens. So

1371
01:16:57,760 --> 01:17:02,600
okay. So I don't know

1372
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:10,080
I want to check the chats everybody.

1373
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:14,600
Yeah. Okay. So

1374
01:17:10,080 --> 01:17:14,600
um you are here.

1375
01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:22,000
Can you see this? Yes. Can you see this

1376
01:17:18,159 --> 01:17:25,600
little point? Okay. Okay. That's the the

1377
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:28,000
moment where a child is abducted into

1378
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:30,640
for instance the 20 and back where you

1379
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:33,840
sign up for the 20 and back. You're

1380
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:36,719
going to do your 20 years.

1381
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:40,000
Okay. Oh, we don't see anything. Going

1382
01:17:36,719 --> 01:17:42,400
to do your 20 years and then it's over.

1383
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:47,960
20.

1384
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:47,960
You are sent back in time.

1385
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:56,000
regressed. Time regressed. Okay. But

1386
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:58,000
then that's the wall.

1387
01:17:56,000 --> 01:18:01,280
But then

1388
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:03,840
you are signing up for another 20 years.

1389
01:18:01,280 --> 01:18:07,280
So you're going to do another one. I'm

1390
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:10,080
going to say you're here.

1391
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:15,800
You're going to do another one.

1392
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:15,800
20 years up. Go back.

1393
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:23,440
While you're here, you are also here

1394
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:25,280
and you see yourself and you say, "Oh my

1395
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:28,159
god, that's me. That's be a clone of

1396
01:18:25,280 --> 01:18:32,239
me." No, it's your altar. It's still

1397
01:18:28,159 --> 01:18:35,440
you. Okay? This is you and this is you

1398
01:18:32,239 --> 01:18:40,719
as a whole. This is time travel. This is

1399
01:18:35,440 --> 01:18:42,640
time travel. Physical time travel. Okay?

1400
01:18:40,719 --> 01:18:45,360
And

1401
01:18:42,640 --> 01:18:48,640
you can interact.

1402
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:51,440
There's no parading.

1403
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:54,239
You can absolutely interact. That's why

1404
01:18:51,440 --> 01:18:56,480
they want people to that's that's the

1405
01:18:54,239 --> 01:18:58,800
law. They want people to forget also

1406
01:18:56,480 --> 01:19:01,600
because

1407
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:04,400
if you don't forget like Tony Rodrig you

1408
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:05,600
change the present

1409
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:07,440
because there's been physical

1410
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:09,440
interaction and you remember

1411
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:13,679
everything's going to happen and you

1412
01:19:09,440 --> 01:19:16,080
know so the the you that's here for

1413
01:19:13,679 --> 01:19:17,520
instance is doing that for a second

1414
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:20,840
time. You are doing that the second

1415
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:20,840
time. Okay.

1416
01:19:21,040 --> 01:19:24,880
So

1417
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:27,520
you're meeting yourself as an an

1418
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:30,080
individual separately physically and you

1419
01:19:27,520 --> 01:19:34,560
tell you tell yourself you tell yourself

1420
01:19:30,080 --> 01:19:36,960
you said hey at that point in time here

1421
01:19:34,560 --> 01:19:40,800
there's a big reptilian that is going to

1422
01:19:36,960 --> 01:19:43,679
eat your arm and so avoid it. So the

1423
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:47,920
little guy here, he avoids it, but he

1424
01:19:43,679 --> 01:19:50,000
change stuff that maybe

1425
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:52,960
were disastrous for the dark fleet or

1426
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:56,239
for the enemy because he kills the

1427
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:59,520
reptilian and he managed to escape or he

1428
01:19:56,239 --> 01:20:01,600
does something very naughty.

1429
01:19:59,520 --> 01:20:04,159
But you that that's why when you come

1430
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:06,239
back here when you come back here your

1431
01:20:04,159 --> 01:20:08,640
memory is wiped that when you sign up a

1432
01:20:06,239 --> 01:20:10,080
second time you don't know and you're

1433
01:20:08,640 --> 01:20:11,920
going to meet this reptilian and be

1434
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:16,920
eaten

1435
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:16,920
or not or something else but anyway

1436
01:20:17,120 --> 01:20:21,199
you know

1437
01:20:19,040 --> 01:20:24,800
you can meet that's it that's not a

1438
01:20:21,199 --> 01:20:26,800
clone that's you as a time traveler and

1439
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:30,320
there can be

1440
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:31,920
many other you many many many many and

1441
01:20:30,320 --> 01:20:34,640
you think there's an army of clothes but

1442
01:20:31,920 --> 01:20:36,480
maybe people do one 20 and back two 20

1443
01:20:34,640 --> 01:20:38,960
and back three 20 and back after three

1444
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:41,440
it's difficult because

1445
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:43,360
uh it's not working very well for the

1446
01:20:41,440 --> 01:20:46,800
the the mind the consciousness they

1447
01:20:43,360 --> 01:20:49,920
don't do a lot they do one two

1448
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:53,840
three is very rare

1449
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:57,360
so I knew I need to use this thing

1450
01:20:53,840 --> 01:20:57,360
um you

1451
01:21:00,159 --> 01:21:05,120
You meet your altars.

1452
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:08,920
You are the sum of all that you have

1453
01:21:05,120 --> 01:21:08,920
been all along.

1454
01:21:09,040 --> 01:21:12,800
And it was always you as a whole in your

1455
01:21:10,880 --> 01:21:17,760
incarnations.

1456
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:21,679
And to say I am not I was or I will be

1457
01:21:17,760 --> 01:21:25,679
is the right thing. It is in tempmporal.

1458
01:21:21,679 --> 01:21:28,640
Our consciousness is eternal. Um

1459
01:21:25,679 --> 01:21:32,560
it's not when you extract yourself okay

1460
01:21:28,640 --> 01:21:34,560
when you are on the linear time

1461
01:21:32,560 --> 01:21:38,640
um

1462
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:42,400
you think I am I was I will be I was I

1463
01:21:38,640 --> 01:21:44,880
am I will be when you are out of linear

1464
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:48,640
time in the the the the

1465
01:21:44,880 --> 01:21:52,560
quantum time field you think I am I am I

1466
01:21:48,640 --> 01:21:56,080
am I am I am I am I am I am

1467
01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:58,960
I am is in temporal

1468
01:21:56,080 --> 01:22:00,480
even when you are on the linear time I

1469
01:21:58,960 --> 01:22:02,800
am

1470
01:22:00,480 --> 01:22:05,120
when the time you say I am you've you

1471
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:07,920
already moved in the future and the

1472
01:22:05,120 --> 01:22:11,120
future is now the present

1473
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:13,040
I am since you've started watching this

1474
01:22:11,120 --> 01:22:14,480
video

1475
01:22:13,040 --> 01:22:19,480
you're not at the same place in the

1476
01:22:14,480 --> 01:22:19,480
galaxy as you were an hour ago

1477
01:22:20,320 --> 01:22:23,520
you know the present is constantly

1478
01:22:22,480 --> 01:22:26,560
moving

1479
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:29,199
The I am is eternal. It's moving. It's a

1480
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:33,719
it's a dynamic, the flow of the the the

1481
01:22:29,199 --> 01:22:33,719
time field, you know.

1482
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:44,400
So yes, it's extraordinary that you can

1483
01:22:39,679 --> 01:22:46,400
converse with past existences of yours.

1484
01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:48,480
Have you ever connected with yourself in

1485
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:50,800
the future? You can in a future

1486
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:53,280
incarnation with consciousness, with the

1487
01:22:50,800 --> 01:22:55,120
higher self. It's perfectly possible.

1488
01:22:53,280 --> 01:22:57,199
You know, time exists as a unified

1489
01:22:55,120 --> 01:23:01,199
field. So you can do connect to any

1490
01:22:57,199 --> 01:23:03,440
point of it. It's all entangled.

1491
01:23:01,199 --> 01:23:05,040
You can talk to yourself in the past.

1492
01:23:03,440 --> 01:23:06,639
You can surely talk to yourself in the

1493
01:23:05,040 --> 01:23:09,840
future.

1494
01:23:06,639 --> 01:23:12,880
Wherever you stand

1495
01:23:09,840 --> 01:23:15,360
in the time field,

1496
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:17,920
wherever you stand in a time field, you

1497
01:23:15,360 --> 01:23:21,239
are an equidistance

1498
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:21,239
of everything.

1499
01:23:25,520 --> 01:23:31,320
like in space,

1500
01:23:27,679 --> 01:23:31,320
like in consciousness.

1501
01:23:32,960 --> 01:23:38,000
So, let's go over some points to make

1502
01:23:35,600 --> 01:23:42,520
sure we get this.

1503
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:42,520
When you talk to aspects of yourself,

1504
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:47,679
is this modifying events in the past?

1505
01:23:45,679 --> 01:23:50,239
No. You will need physical interaction

1506
01:23:47,679 --> 01:23:53,360
for that. You need to actually transpose

1507
01:23:50,239 --> 01:23:55,760
physically in a moment in spaceime.

1508
01:23:53,360 --> 01:23:57,600
When I speak to myself as incarnated in

1509
01:23:55,760 --> 01:23:59,600
other temporal moments, I am speaking to

1510
01:23:57,600 --> 01:24:01,760
my own consciousness. Call it the higher

1511
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:04,000
self.

1512
01:24:01,760 --> 01:24:07,040
Unless I travel physically through time

1513
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:10,960
to connect to a particular moment, it

1514
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:13,120
does not create any incidence.

1515
01:24:10,960 --> 01:24:15,520
If for example, I am telling my higher

1516
01:24:13,120 --> 01:24:17,199
self who lived in Atlantis, hey, get on

1517
01:24:15,520 --> 01:24:19,040
that spacecraft before the big wave

1518
01:24:17,199 --> 01:24:21,520
hits.

1519
01:24:19,040 --> 01:24:23,120
that will not have any incidence but if

1520
01:24:21,520 --> 01:24:25,440
I actually travel back in time

1521
01:24:23,120 --> 01:24:27,600
physically to that moment well yes I can

1522
01:24:25,440 --> 01:24:29,440
meet physically with myself back and

1523
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:31,760
influencer

1524
01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:34,159
that's why physical time travels is

1525
01:24:31,760 --> 01:24:37,199
unethical unnatural and requires

1526
01:24:34,159 --> 01:24:40,639
technology because it's unnatural it

1527
01:24:37,199 --> 01:24:45,639
goes against universal laws of evolution

1528
01:24:40,639 --> 01:24:45,639
the creator's prime directive

1529
01:24:45,840 --> 01:24:51,000
because time is a field and not a linear

1530
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:51,000
construct.

1531
01:24:51,199 --> 01:24:55,600
Can you naturally choose to incarnate

1532
01:24:52,880 --> 01:24:57,920
from the future? Well, no. As this would

1533
01:24:55,600 --> 01:25:01,360
be a deroggation as the envoy programs

1534
01:24:57,920 --> 01:25:04,360
were with the creation of time dilation

1535
01:25:01,360 --> 01:25:04,360
pods.

1536
01:25:04,560 --> 01:25:09,600
Incarnating in a planetary matrix starts

1537
01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:14,000
a cycle and you can only go forward

1538
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:15,920
because it serves evolution progression.

1539
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:18,480
Progress

1540
01:25:15,920 --> 01:25:20,080
and a spir spiral of evolution is

1541
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:23,199
progressive.

1542
01:25:20,080 --> 01:25:25,920
The golden mean the Fibonacci sequence

1543
01:25:23,199 --> 01:25:28,800
cannot go backwards. The numbers can

1544
01:25:25,920 --> 01:25:33,960
only add to themselves. Construct this

1545
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:33,960
is evolution. The meaning of creation.

1546
01:25:34,480 --> 01:25:40,800
There is no past, no future. There is

1547
01:25:38,320 --> 01:25:42,800
only the quantum field, the quantum time

1548
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:44,800
field.

1549
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:48,920
Where in the absolute you are not

1550
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:48,920
subject to linear gravity.

1551
01:25:49,280 --> 01:25:55,520
Extract yourself

1552
01:25:52,000 --> 01:26:00,760
from linear thinking.

1553
01:25:55,520 --> 01:26:00,760
Think as the field.

1554
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:07,000
So would you like to talk about time

1555
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:07,000
machines?

1556
01:26:07,040 --> 01:26:13,199
Uhhuh.

1557
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:15,679
The time machines.

1558
01:26:13,199 --> 01:26:17,360
Well, thanks to Dan Willis.

1559
01:26:15,679 --> 01:26:19,440
Um

1560
01:26:17,360 --> 01:26:21,679
Dan Willis told me yesterday about the

1561
01:26:19,440 --> 01:26:23,920
Delawir quantum holographic camera

1562
01:26:21,679 --> 01:26:25,360
project, an interdimensional imaging

1563
01:26:23,920 --> 01:26:31,159
device.

1564
01:26:25,360 --> 01:26:31,159
Um, so I'm going to share.

1565
01:26:31,280 --> 01:26:36,120
Um, where am I? Share.

1566
01:26:36,400 --> 01:26:44,679
Okay. Okay.

1567
01:26:39,679 --> 01:26:44,679
It's on this website. Um,

1568
01:26:45,520 --> 01:26:48,520
screen.

1569
01:26:48,800 --> 01:26:55,040
Select Marcel Vogel Crystal Research.

1570
01:26:52,159 --> 01:26:58,960
Yes. Okay.

1571
01:26:55,040 --> 01:27:02,600
So um you can see here I hope it's uh

1572
01:26:58,960 --> 01:27:02,600
working. You see

1573
01:27:03,199 --> 01:27:06,760
above marcelvog.org/came.html.

1574
01:27:09,920 --> 01:27:17,280
So this camera

1575
01:27:13,280 --> 01:27:21,360
was um something that was able to

1576
01:27:17,280 --> 01:27:24,560
regress the vision the hologram of for

1577
01:27:21,360 --> 01:27:27,440
instance a body and take photos of it in

1578
01:27:24,560 --> 01:27:29,440
the past that um hologram of a woman

1579
01:27:27,440 --> 01:27:31,520
that was the body of a woman that was

1580
01:27:29,440 --> 01:27:33,840
regressed to the fetus state and the

1581
01:27:31,520 --> 01:27:36,480
photo was taken. So, you have all the

1582
01:27:33,840 --> 01:27:41,199
blueprints if you go to that address and

1583
01:27:36,480 --> 01:27:46,159
the photos of what it looks like

1584
01:27:41,199 --> 01:27:49,920
and all the experiments. Um,

1585
01:27:46,159 --> 01:27:52,920
so I have a few slides I want to show

1586
01:27:49,920 --> 01:27:52,920
you.

1587
01:27:56,480 --> 01:28:03,040
H Okay.

1588
01:27:59,679 --> 01:28:05,600
Um so

1589
01:28:03,040 --> 01:28:08,080
it's an interdimensional imaging device

1590
01:28:05,600 --> 01:28:11,360
and u there's a key statement in the

1591
01:28:08,080 --> 01:28:14,560
opinion of de laawir who said time is a

1592
01:28:11,360 --> 01:28:17,840
vector of magnetic

1593
01:28:14,560 --> 01:28:20,800
spectrum and that spectrum has a place

1594
01:28:17,840 --> 01:28:23,520
in itself for events. There is a

1595
01:28:20,800 --> 01:28:27,280
preysical world in which the camera

1596
01:28:23,520 --> 01:28:34,239
might be expected to operate.

1597
01:28:27,280 --> 01:28:37,239
So, um, where are my slides? Here.

1598
01:28:34,239 --> 01:28:37,239
Okay.

1599
01:28:42,239 --> 01:28:47,239
Um,

1600
01:28:44,239 --> 01:28:47,239
difficult.

1601
01:28:48,560 --> 01:28:53,360
The slides are not working, so I'm not

1602
01:28:50,239 --> 01:28:58,080
going to lose time. Uh, you we have the

1603
01:28:53,360 --> 01:29:01,560
address. So, um, I'll put the the

1604
01:28:58,080 --> 01:29:01,560
address is

1605
01:29:02,400 --> 01:29:05,400
marcelvog.org/camera.html

1606
01:29:10,080 --> 01:29:13,080
marcelvogal.org/camera.html.

1607
01:29:19,360 --> 01:29:25,120
I had written that on a slide. Uh uh uh.

1608
01:29:23,360 --> 01:29:28,679
Okay.

1609
01:29:25,120 --> 01:29:28,679
Second attempt.

1610
01:29:31,120 --> 01:29:39,679
Okay. Not working.

1611
01:29:35,120 --> 01:29:42,560
So um this is a very interesting uh time

1612
01:29:39,679 --> 01:29:45,040
time machine that was affecting the the

1613
01:29:42,560 --> 01:29:47,760
hologram of of a body for instance of

1614
01:29:45,040 --> 01:29:50,719
reality. And this is a technology that

1615
01:29:47,760 --> 01:29:53,679
is used in the medical beds. you are

1616
01:29:50,719 --> 01:29:58,159
able to attune the holog the damage

1617
01:29:53,679 --> 01:30:02,480
hologram to um an earlier version

1618
01:29:58,159 --> 01:30:05,760
that was healthier and as Jinhan says

1619
01:30:02,480 --> 01:30:10,400
the universe tends towards perfection.

1620
01:30:05,760 --> 01:30:12,400
So the the dissonant material will

1621
01:30:10,400 --> 01:30:16,639
attune to the resonant material

1622
01:30:12,400 --> 01:30:18,960
naturally and it will heal.

1623
01:30:16,639 --> 01:30:21,520
Talking about time machines now more

1624
01:30:18,960 --> 01:30:24,159
specifically

1625
01:30:21,520 --> 01:30:27,280
we have there's the chronovvisor. So

1626
01:30:24,159 --> 01:30:31,280
that's a chronovvisor. Uh that dawir

1627
01:30:27,280 --> 01:30:34,280
machine is also a chronovvisor.

1628
01:30:31,280 --> 01:30:34,280
Um

1629
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:39,040
another chronovvisor is the looking

1630
01:30:36,639 --> 01:30:41,199
glass looking glass device that was

1631
01:30:39,040 --> 01:30:43,040
given by the neighbor. It was a cube

1632
01:30:41,199 --> 01:30:46,880
given by the neighbor. There was one in

1633
01:30:43,040 --> 01:30:48,960
area 51. There was I think two

1634
01:30:46,880 --> 01:30:52,800
uh maybe three I think at my to my

1635
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:55,840
knowledge about two. Um and they

1636
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:59,920
they allowed people to especially

1637
01:30:55,840 --> 01:31:04,560
politicians to uh

1638
01:30:59,920 --> 01:31:06,239
to alter time to modify time.

1639
01:31:04,560 --> 01:31:08,400
And

1640
01:31:06,239 --> 01:31:11,120
when I'm going to tell you about the the

1641
01:31:08,400 --> 01:31:13,120
Dan Anunnaki technology time device,

1642
01:31:11,120 --> 01:31:18,719
you're going to see that there's a great

1643
01:31:13,120 --> 01:31:21,760
parallel with the Nebu

1644
01:31:18,719 --> 01:31:24,880
looking glass cube

1645
01:31:21,760 --> 01:31:29,600
a lot. It's two different technologies,

1646
01:31:24,880 --> 01:31:31,840
but it's working for the same purpose.

1647
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:34,880
changing events

1648
01:31:31,840 --> 01:31:39,199
to see changing events in the present to

1649
01:31:34,880 --> 01:31:41,280
see how it's going to go in the future.

1650
01:31:39,199 --> 01:31:43,840
And if it doesn't go as you want, you

1651
01:31:41,280 --> 01:31:46,719
rechange the present. You do something

1652
01:31:43,840 --> 01:31:50,440
else. Politicians have been doing that a

1653
01:31:46,719 --> 01:31:50,440
lot with this device.

1654
01:31:50,639 --> 01:31:57,760
Another chronisor. A pity I don't have

1655
01:31:53,280 --> 01:31:59,920
the slides. Um I have them. I have it in

1656
01:31:57,760 --> 01:32:05,639
here.

1657
01:31:59,920 --> 01:32:05,639
is the device I met on the metron ship.

1658
01:32:07,520 --> 01:32:10,520
Um,

1659
01:32:11,840 --> 01:32:16,360
here we go. Here it is.

1660
01:32:17,760 --> 01:32:25,440
Or was it in the cedars? Oh, it's in the

1661
01:32:19,679 --> 01:32:30,679
cedars. Excuse me. So many books. Um,

1662
01:32:25,440 --> 01:32:30,679
okay. Yes, my little thing. Wrong book.

1663
01:32:31,120 --> 01:32:38,639
Distract myself. So I don't expect you

1664
01:32:34,159 --> 01:32:42,639
you find it. Um this is

1665
01:32:38,639 --> 01:32:45,040
a chronovvisor on the metron ship.

1666
01:32:42,639 --> 01:32:49,120
There was a tube with a sort of plasma

1667
01:32:45,040 --> 01:32:50,560
in it and you would put your hands

1668
01:32:49,120 --> 01:32:52,080
interface with it and you would

1669
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:54,320
interface your consciousness a bit with

1670
01:32:52,080 --> 01:32:57,120
like with a crystal. Yeah.

1671
01:32:54,320 --> 01:33:01,120
And this would show you, you say a date

1672
01:32:57,120 --> 01:33:03,760
in time and it will show you um

1673
01:33:01,120 --> 01:33:06,800
the future, but it's a chronovvisor.

1674
01:33:03,760 --> 01:33:08,880
It's not like the looking glass

1675
01:33:06,800 --> 01:33:10,800
uh that the nebu gave to the earthling

1676
01:33:08,880 --> 01:33:13,120
which were chronovisor as well, but it

1677
01:33:10,800 --> 01:33:16,480
was more looking how things are going to

1678
01:33:13,120 --> 01:33:19,760
change. No, this one is tells you

1679
01:33:16,480 --> 01:33:24,480
exactly how it's going to happen.

1680
01:33:19,760 --> 01:33:27,520
So that's something that is very very

1681
01:33:24,480 --> 01:33:31,840
important because this device this alpha

1682
01:33:27,520 --> 01:33:35,600
centurion uh chronovvisor

1683
01:33:31,840 --> 01:33:36,960
tells you the real future

1684
01:33:35,600 --> 01:33:39,679
how it's going to be after all the

1685
01:33:36,960 --> 01:33:42,400
temporal wars. It's actually projecting

1686
01:33:39,679 --> 01:33:46,159
in the future and tells you how it is

1687
01:33:42,400 --> 01:33:49,360
stable. That's how I could see 2000

1688
01:33:46,159 --> 01:33:53,040
years in the future. And there's been uh

1689
01:33:49,360 --> 01:33:56,639
pictures I publish in this book drawings

1690
01:33:53,040 --> 01:33:59,040
of the future as I as I saw it, you

1691
01:33:56,639 --> 01:34:03,639
know.

1692
01:33:59,040 --> 01:34:03,639
So, um it's all in there.

1693
01:34:04,960 --> 01:34:07,960
Um

1694
01:34:08,639 --> 01:34:16,080
and also there's uh so now something I

1695
01:34:12,080 --> 01:34:20,400
haven't uh spoken about um really yet.

1696
01:34:16,080 --> 01:34:22,719
Um it's the the device the anunaki

1697
01:34:20,400 --> 01:34:24,320
device the amala

1698
01:34:22,719 --> 01:34:27,600
amala

1699
01:34:24,320 --> 01:34:29,920
the arala is the registry of future

1700
01:34:27,600 --> 01:34:32,800
events.

1701
01:34:29,920 --> 01:34:36,239
It's a holographic device

1702
01:34:32,800 --> 01:34:38,880
that can read time.

1703
01:34:36,239 --> 01:34:41,920
It has a holographic screens and you

1704
01:34:38,880 --> 01:34:44,560
interfere in the same way as with any

1705
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:46,480
other regular advanced technology

1706
01:34:44,560 --> 01:34:49,800
devices.

1707
01:34:46,480 --> 01:34:49,800
through consciousness.

1708
01:34:50,800 --> 01:34:54,880
The amala is used as a sort of cosmic

1709
01:34:53,360 --> 01:34:57,040
calendar

1710
01:34:54,880 --> 01:35:00,239
displaying important events that will

1711
01:34:57,040 --> 01:35:02,800
occur on a given planet in the future

1712
01:35:00,239 --> 01:35:06,480
based on the algorithm of current

1713
01:35:02,800 --> 01:35:09,920
events. It is not an absolute prediction

1714
01:35:06,480 --> 01:35:12,560
of the future but rather a projected

1715
01:35:09,920 --> 01:35:16,000
calculation of how things are more

1716
01:35:12,560 --> 01:35:20,120
likely to unfold based on the algorithm

1717
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:20,120
of the current data.

1718
01:35:20,480 --> 01:35:27,120
So the results change

1719
01:35:23,199 --> 01:35:29,440
as the present events unfold.

1720
01:35:27,120 --> 01:35:32,080
It is more of a tool than say

1721
01:35:29,440 --> 01:35:35,040
chronovvisor for instance like the one I

1722
01:35:32,080 --> 01:35:36,639
accessed twice on the met ship. What I

1723
01:35:35,040 --> 01:35:39,520
saw on the metron ship was a fixed

1724
01:35:36,639 --> 01:35:42,800
immovable feature. The amala is not. The

1725
01:35:39,520 --> 01:35:45,920
amala is a time calculating device. You

1726
01:35:42,800 --> 01:35:49,120
can consult this device whenever you

1727
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:51,120
want to make an important decision and

1728
01:35:49,120 --> 01:35:53,600
see what the future consequences would

1729
01:35:51,120 --> 01:35:56,239
be. You can see as far as you want, but

1730
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:58,880
it becomes a bit blurry as you look

1731
01:35:56,239 --> 01:36:00,639
further in time.

1732
01:35:58,880 --> 01:36:02,880
The reason why the Amala is not

1733
01:36:00,639 --> 01:36:06,080
perfectly reliable technology is that

1734
01:36:02,880 --> 01:36:09,920
its calculation do not take in account

1735
01:36:06,080 --> 01:36:13,360
possible external inputs creating future

1736
01:36:09,920 --> 01:36:16,639
disturbances that are not listed in the

1737
01:36:13,360 --> 01:36:18,719
current algorithm of the present.

1738
01:36:16,639 --> 01:36:20,880
A chronovvisor like the one on the metal

1739
01:36:18,719 --> 01:36:23,760
chip for instance in the contrary will

1740
01:36:20,880 --> 01:36:29,159
see the future as a whole with all the

1741
01:36:23,760 --> 01:36:29,159
inputs on the way into the equation.

1742
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:36,400
So there is one amala amala

1743
01:36:34,320 --> 01:36:39,520
that is located on the Nibberu ship of

1744
01:36:36,400 --> 01:36:42,480
course um a large room with a high

1745
01:36:39,520 --> 01:36:46,800
ceiling and um there's uh all sorts of

1746
01:36:42,480 --> 01:36:50,480
equipment around and um and there's this

1747
01:36:46,800 --> 01:36:53,679
oval metal mirror.

1748
01:36:50,480 --> 01:36:58,560
It's about 9 ft high. It's mounted on a

1749
01:36:53,679 --> 01:37:00,960
pedestal and you put you so you put on a

1750
01:36:58,560 --> 01:37:06,800
a large headset that looks like a

1751
01:37:00,960 --> 01:37:09,199
futuristic helmet with diodes and um and

1752
01:37:06,800 --> 01:37:12,480
kind of weird stuff sticking out. And

1753
01:37:09,199 --> 01:37:15,199
there's it's carved with very fine fine

1754
01:37:12,480 --> 01:37:16,960
symbols as well, finally edged symbols.

1755
01:37:15,199 --> 01:37:19,920
And you place your hands on the two

1756
01:37:16,960 --> 01:37:22,239
triangular pads of a console in front of

1757
01:37:19,920 --> 01:37:23,760
the mirror.

1758
01:37:22,239 --> 01:37:25,360
And then they lit up when your

1759
01:37:23,760 --> 01:37:27,920
consciousness

1760
01:37:25,360 --> 01:37:31,360
interfaces. And at the same time, the

1761
01:37:27,920 --> 01:37:33,840
diodes on the helmet, they they um they

1762
01:37:31,360 --> 01:37:36,400
kind of whistle.

1763
01:37:33,840 --> 01:37:38,400
And anac technology works pretty much

1764
01:37:36,400 --> 01:37:40,639
the same way for most things, you know,

1765
01:37:38,400 --> 01:37:44,000
interface of consciousness.

1766
01:37:40,639 --> 01:37:46,719
So you stand there with your helmet and

1767
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:50,960
your your hands on that these um

1768
01:37:46,719 --> 01:37:54,159
triangles and you face the mirror. Okay.

1769
01:37:50,960 --> 01:37:55,920
And so remember it's not a real future

1770
01:37:54,159 --> 01:37:58,159
telling machine. It's a calculation

1771
01:37:55,920 --> 01:38:02,000
device, you know. So you need to ask for

1772
01:37:58,159 --> 01:38:03,840
a date. No, sorry. You need not to ask

1773
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:06,000
for a date

1774
01:38:03,840 --> 01:38:11,119
like on a metal mothership, but you need

1775
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:12,719
to ask for the result of an action.

1776
01:38:11,119 --> 01:38:18,280
So

1777
01:38:12,719 --> 01:38:18,280
for instance you say okay

1778
01:38:18,800 --> 01:38:24,719
100 years if

1779
01:38:22,320 --> 01:38:28,800
I do this what will be the consequence

1780
01:38:24,719 --> 01:38:31,280
in 100 years okay and you see you see it

1781
01:38:28,800 --> 01:38:34,159
you see it

1782
01:38:31,280 --> 01:38:36,239
so there's a lot of people a lot of

1783
01:38:34,159 --> 01:38:39,360
anarch people who have used this this

1784
01:38:36,239 --> 01:38:41,679
machine so here on board the nibir who

1785
01:38:39,360 --> 01:38:43,840
just locked it in the room and with DNA

1786
01:38:41,679 --> 01:38:46,320
frequency only him can access it can

1787
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:49,840
open the door because that was starting

1788
01:38:46,320 --> 01:38:51,920
to be a game with uh you know this um

1789
01:38:49,840 --> 01:38:53,840
dysfunctional family and le and all the

1790
01:38:51,920 --> 01:38:56,560
rest. So, and it looks a little bit like

1791
01:38:53,840 --> 01:38:58,800
the looking glass device that was kept

1792
01:38:56,560 --> 01:39:01,520
um in Nevada.

1793
01:38:58,800 --> 01:39:04,000
You just look at the what are going to

1794
01:39:01,520 --> 01:39:07,000
be the consequences of your actions, you

1795
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:07,000
know.

1796
01:39:07,040 --> 01:39:11,760
So, um

1797
01:39:10,239 --> 01:39:15,520
yeah.

1798
01:39:11,760 --> 01:39:17,920
So, this is what I could say about um

1799
01:39:15,520 --> 01:39:23,440
time traveling machines, time looking

1800
01:39:17,920 --> 01:39:23,440
machine um and time

1801
01:39:25,119 --> 01:39:28,119
So

1802
01:39:28,159 --> 01:39:40,600
it see it sounds complex when you are

1803
01:39:33,119 --> 01:39:40,600
in on linear time but um you know

1804
01:39:40,719 --> 01:39:43,960
it isn't

1805
01:39:44,400 --> 01:39:49,800
it isn't in the time quantum build.

1806
01:39:51,360 --> 01:39:59,440
So, I hope here we go. I hope you enjoy

1807
01:39:55,360 --> 01:40:01,760
this. Um I try to repeat points over and

1808
01:39:59,440 --> 01:40:04,000
over again to make sure everyone

1809
01:40:01,760 --> 01:40:08,159
understands it because it's explic

1810
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:11,600
expressing a concept a reality that is

1811
01:40:08,159 --> 01:40:13,119
in nonlinear time with linear time

1812
01:40:11,600 --> 01:40:16,320
expressions

1813
01:40:13,119 --> 01:40:19,360
to people who live on linear time and

1814
01:40:16,320 --> 01:40:21,679
think on linear time. So it's was a bit

1815
01:40:19,360 --> 01:40:26,159
of a challenge

1816
01:40:21,679 --> 01:40:29,760
but I hope you uh you enjoyed it. Um, I

1817
01:40:26,159 --> 01:40:33,520
am now going to answer the Q&A.

1818
01:40:29,760 --> 01:40:37,560
So, um,

1819
01:40:33,520 --> 01:40:37,560
and we're going to have some fun.

1820
01:40:40,719 --> 01:40:44,119
There we go.

1821
01:40:45,280 --> 01:40:51,520
Where my looking glass devices? Present

1822
01:40:48,480 --> 01:40:53,600
looking glass device.

1823
01:40:51,520 --> 01:40:56,600
That's my looking glass device for the

1824
01:40:53,600 --> 01:40:56,600
present.

1825
01:40:58,800 --> 01:41:04,480
It is

1826
01:41:01,360 --> 01:41:06,080
reading glasses. Okay.

1827
01:41:04,480 --> 01:41:11,520
Okay.

1828
01:41:06,080 --> 01:41:14,719
Now I'm accessing the Q&A uh section. So

1829
01:41:11,520 --> 01:41:18,560
I won't be able to see the chat anymore.

1830
01:41:14,719 --> 01:41:22,560
So if there is um sound problem or

1831
01:41:18,560 --> 01:41:25,440
something like that uh

1832
01:41:22,560 --> 01:41:27,840
I'm going to check the private uh chat.

1833
01:41:25,440 --> 01:41:30,480
Okay.

1834
01:41:27,840 --> 01:41:34,880
I hope everything will go well. Okay.

1835
01:41:30,480 --> 01:41:38,000
Let's let's go for these questions.

1836
01:41:34,880 --> 01:41:41,239
Okay. So what do we got there that we

1837
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:41,239
have there?

1838
01:41:43,920 --> 01:41:49,199
Okay.

1839
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:50,560
Oh, before you go, I need to say some

1840
01:41:49,199 --> 01:41:53,760
not going to go now. There's a

1841
01:41:50,560 --> 01:41:57,760
questions, but um I will repeat this

1842
01:41:53,760 --> 01:42:02,400
after the Q&A, but um I will be in

1843
01:41:57,760 --> 01:42:04,080
Denver, Colorado this September 27th 29.

1844
01:42:02,400 --> 01:42:06,159
Well, not in Denver actually in

1845
01:42:04,080 --> 01:42:08,080
Westminster. It's between Denver and

1846
01:42:06,159 --> 01:42:10,320
Boulder, but it's Denver airport. That's

1847
01:42:08,080 --> 01:42:12,400
why we say Denver for the galactic

1848
01:42:10,320 --> 01:42:14,800
spiritual informers connection

1849
01:42:12,400 --> 01:42:17,520
conference the third one and that's

1850
01:42:14,800 --> 01:42:18,960
going to be amazing. Um I'm going to

1851
01:42:17,520 --> 01:42:20,719
talk about consciousness but

1852
01:42:18,960 --> 01:42:22,239
consciousness tech interface

1853
01:42:20,719 --> 01:42:24,400
technologies.

1854
01:42:22,239 --> 01:42:27,840
So that's going to be again and

1855
01:42:24,400 --> 01:42:30,320

1856
01:42:27,840 --> 01:42:33,760

1857
01:42:30,320 --> 01:42:36,159

1858
01:42:33,760 --> 01:42:39,360

1860
01:42:39,360 --> 01:42:45,760

01:42:52,159 --> 01:42:56,719
I'm climbing on that stage. I I'm sick.

1866
01:42:55,040 --> 01:42:59,520

1869
01:43:03,760 --> 01:43:09,760
Oh my goodness. Michael Salah, Christian

Tony Rodrig, the handsome Tony Rodrig.

1876
01:43:26,800 --> 01:43:30,960
I'm sure I forget people, but uh there's

1877
01:43:29,679 --> 01:43:33,199
going to be a lot of people on that

1878
01:43:30,960 --> 01:43:35,199
stage. And Denny Henderson as well. So,

1879
01:43:33,199 --> 01:43:37,440
um,

1880
01:43:35,199 --> 01:43:40,320
if you can make it, that'd be amazing.

1881
01:43:37,440 --> 01:43:43,840
Be amazing.

1882
01:43:40,320 --> 01:43:45,840
First question, 44 votes.

1883
01:43:43,840 --> 01:43:49,199
Hi, Helena. You are awesome. Thank you

1884
01:43:45,840 --> 01:43:51,360
very much. What happens to your era,

1885
01:43:49,199 --> 01:43:53,440
body, consciousness, and future timeline

1886
01:43:51,360 --> 01:43:56,000
after you have come back in time to help

1887
01:43:53,440 --> 01:43:58,080
planet Earth ascend? Oh, I've answered

1888
01:43:56,000 --> 01:44:00,719
this one. I'm I'm reading it. Reading

1889
01:43:58,080 --> 01:44:03,119
it. After your current timeline,

1890
01:44:00,719 --> 01:44:05,360
lifetime, sorry.

1891
01:44:03,119 --> 01:44:08,560
Does your consciousness go back to your

1892
01:44:05,360 --> 01:44:12,080
body in stasis on error? Oh yes, I

1893
01:44:08,560 --> 01:44:14,320
answered this question. Um, will you

1894
01:44:12,080 --> 01:44:17,199
remember what happened? Yes, of course.

1895
01:44:14,320 --> 01:44:20,080
Because I arrived in my time dilation

1896
01:44:17,199 --> 01:44:21,520
bubble and uh I'll remember everything

1897
01:44:20,080 --> 01:44:23,600
because it's doesn't go through

1898
01:44:21,520 --> 01:44:26,880
incarnation.

1899
01:44:23,600 --> 01:44:28,960
Yes, because I go through a pod. So I'm

1900
01:44:26,880 --> 01:44:32,560
not going through incarnation and

1901
01:44:28,960 --> 01:44:36,639
forgetting stuff. No.

1902
01:44:32,560 --> 01:44:38,719
So uh thank you Moira. Um there was a

1903
01:44:36,639 --> 01:44:41,600
question I

1904
01:44:38,719 --> 01:44:44,880
in it I had an answer.

1905
01:44:41,600 --> 01:44:49,440
See you in September. Next question. 32

1906
01:44:44,880 --> 01:44:52,239
votes from Mark Verver.

1907
01:44:49,440 --> 01:44:55,840
Dear Elena, we all know that our history

1908
01:44:52,239 --> 01:44:57,520
and time has been altered.

1909
01:44:55,840 --> 01:44:59,840
We don't even know for sure we live in

1910
01:44:57,520 --> 01:45:02,800
the year 2024.

1911
01:44:59,840 --> 01:45:05,280
Terra time. That is right.

1912
01:45:02,800 --> 01:45:08,159
Please share with us where our timeline

1913
01:45:05,280 --> 01:45:11,360
was altered and why. I know that the

1914
01:45:08,159 --> 01:45:13,679
aids and the federation are able to

1915
01:45:11,360 --> 01:45:15,360
share the truth about our time. Thank

1916
01:45:13,679 --> 01:45:17,520
you so much for your information, your

1917
01:45:15,360 --> 01:45:21,760
love and compassion for Terra. I love

1918
01:45:17,520 --> 01:45:25,520
you. I love you too. I love all of you.

1919
01:45:21,760 --> 01:45:27,520
So, um, as I said, it was altered uh the

1920
01:45:25,520 --> 01:45:29,199
month during the month before because

1921
01:45:27,520 --> 01:45:33,679
you don't alter timeline like this. It

1922
01:45:29,199 --> 01:45:38,400
takes 5 years, a little bit less. So, it

1923
01:45:33,679 --> 01:45:40,719
was completed in December 2022.

1924
01:45:38,400 --> 01:45:42,880
Um,

1925
01:45:40,719 --> 01:45:47,119
a little bit before actually, but it was

1926
01:45:42,880 --> 01:45:48,719
a process, you know. Um,

1927
01:45:47,119 --> 01:45:51,280
so

1928
01:45:48,719 --> 01:45:54,639
and I have answered to the the rest in

1929
01:45:51,280 --> 01:45:57,679
the the the webinar. So, you you got

1930
01:45:54,639 --> 01:45:59,760
already your answers, Mark.

1931
01:45:57,679 --> 01:46:02,239
There's a There's a lot of questions

1932
01:45:59,760 --> 01:46:07,119
I've answered already too already. So

1933
01:46:02,239 --> 01:46:10,159
with 30 votes, Edwin Ketah, hello Edwin,

1934
01:46:07,119 --> 01:46:12,560
how are you? Dear Elena, thanks for all

1935
01:46:10,159 --> 01:46:14,080
the information you have given us. You

1936
01:46:12,560 --> 01:46:17,280
have mentioned that the deep state is

1937
01:46:14,080 --> 01:46:20,000
collapsing. Yes, it is because it is so

1938
01:46:17,280 --> 01:46:22,480
secret. I don't actually know what is

1939
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:25,199
happening to the deep state. Do you the

1940
01:46:22,480 --> 01:46:27,360
federation of some other entity have a

1941
01:46:25,199 --> 01:46:28,400
way of monitoring the fall of the deep

1942
01:46:27,360 --> 01:46:30,719
state?

1943
01:46:28,400 --> 01:46:32,639
Can you give us a percentage remaining

1944
01:46:30,719 --> 01:46:35,920
like you did when the regressives were

1945
01:46:32,639 --> 01:46:38,400
being kicked out of our solar system?

1946
01:46:35,920 --> 01:46:40,880
I do not have this technology to know

1947
01:46:38,400 --> 01:46:43,600
what's going on with the deep state. It

1948
01:46:40,880 --> 01:46:45,440
is secret because it's an operation that

1949
01:46:43,600 --> 01:46:47,760
is ongoing.

1950
01:46:45,440 --> 01:46:49,679
Okay. When it's ongoing, we're not given

1951
01:46:47,760 --> 01:46:52,800
the details of the operation because it

1952
01:46:49,679 --> 01:46:55,119
will compromise the operation. Um, all I

1953
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:58,480
can say it is really collapsing. are

1954
01:46:55,119 --> 01:47:02,080
still people in power.

1955
01:46:58,480 --> 01:47:03,920
Uh they still have power. But um if you

1956
01:47:02,080 --> 01:47:06,800
follow my Star Nation news in the Star

1957
01:47:03,920 --> 01:47:11,199
Nation news 35

1958
01:47:06,800 --> 01:47:16,080
two weeks ago, Thoran Erdon gave uh

1959
01:47:11,199 --> 01:47:21,360
information about the disclosure plan

1960
01:47:16,080 --> 01:47:23,679
and uh he said that because you cannot

1961
01:47:21,360 --> 01:47:25,600
take them by front, it would cause chaos

1962
01:47:23,679 --> 01:47:28,320
and damages, you know, collateral

1963
01:47:25,600 --> 01:47:33,440
damages. So they use ruse and

1964
01:47:28,320 --> 01:47:35,040
infiltrated a lot of these um

1965
01:47:33,440 --> 01:47:36,639
different organizations of the deep

1966
01:47:35,040 --> 01:47:38,960
state. It was a long process of

1967
01:47:36,639 --> 01:47:41,920
infiltration to collapse them by the

1968
01:47:38,960 --> 01:47:43,520
inside. They they did exactly like the

1969
01:47:41,920 --> 01:47:46,880
enemy does you know they collapse the

1970
01:47:43,520 --> 01:47:50,400
the organization from the inside.

1971
01:47:46,880 --> 01:47:52,639
That's as simple as that. So

1972
01:47:50,400 --> 01:47:56,159
I cannot tell more just that it's

1973
01:47:52,639 --> 01:47:58,239
collapsing and losing power. It it it's

1974
01:47:56,159 --> 01:48:01,600
it plays like if it doesn't, but it

1975
01:47:58,239 --> 01:48:05,440
does. It does. It does. It does.

1976
01:48:01,600 --> 01:48:08,400
A question by Arthur Worth.

1977
01:48:05,440 --> 01:48:13,760
33 votes. Elena. Did Prince Ia soul

1978
01:48:08,400 --> 01:48:16,480
separated some 450 year th,000 years ago

1979
01:48:13,760 --> 01:48:19,840
from the nine then dropped down into

1980
01:48:16,480 --> 01:48:21,920
five density to incarnate into is No, it

1981
01:48:19,840 --> 01:48:25,040
didn't drop from from the nine. It's not

1982
01:48:21,920 --> 01:48:26,719
it's nothing to do with the nine.

1983
01:48:25,040 --> 01:48:29,440
Um,

1984
01:48:26,719 --> 01:48:32,000
hence explaining why Thorhan stated that

1985
01:48:29,440 --> 01:48:34,239
he is the third most powerful person in

1986
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:37,360
the universe, explaining his

1987
01:48:34,239 --> 01:48:40,400
extraordinary abilities to create life

1988
01:48:37,360 --> 01:48:42,239
as a cosmic alchemist and other skills.

1989
01:48:40,400 --> 01:48:44,239
Thank you.

1990
01:48:42,239 --> 01:48:48,880
um

1991
01:48:44,239 --> 01:48:53,520
is the third most powerful being in this

1992
01:48:48,880 --> 01:48:55,360
universe after the nine you know uh

1993
01:48:53,520 --> 01:48:57,679
because he's a cosmic alchemist he

1994
01:48:55,360 --> 01:49:00,800
underwent through incredible

1995
01:48:57,679 --> 01:49:03,600
transformation the abra transformation

1996
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:06,400
the immortality of the body also is

1997
01:49:03,600 --> 01:49:10,360
quite painful and challenging you know

1998
01:49:06,400 --> 01:49:10,360
uh so um

1999
01:49:10,880 --> 01:49:18,239
the result is amazing.

2000
01:49:14,800 --> 01:49:19,679
Postcrytom, I see Julian Assange is a

2001
01:49:18,239 --> 01:49:22,080
very important person in the great

2002
01:49:19,679 --> 01:49:25,119
awakening movement. I received an email

2003
01:49:22,080 --> 01:49:27,440
from his brother. Oh, Gabriel Shipton

2004
01:49:25,119 --> 01:49:30,480
thanking me for helping them free

2005
01:49:27,440 --> 01:49:33,840
Julian. We are celebrating in Australia

2006
01:49:30,480 --> 01:49:36,719
his victory. Arthur, were you part of

2007
01:49:33,840 --> 01:49:40,719
his liberation? You've got to tell us

2008
01:49:36,719 --> 01:49:42,719
more about that now, Arthur.

2009
01:49:40,719 --> 01:49:47,920
We want to know more. We want to know

2010
01:49:42,719 --> 01:49:50,639
more. Um, so, um, I see comments

2011
01:49:47,920 --> 01:49:53,600
underneath. Oh. Oh. Oh,

2012
01:49:50,639 --> 01:49:56,480
no. You didn't say anything. Okay. Well,

2013
01:49:53,600 --> 01:49:59,199
you know, just before

2014
01:49:56,480 --> 01:50:03,360
uh the day before we learned about

2015
01:49:59,199 --> 01:50:08,159
Julian Assange, be liberated.

2016
01:50:03,360 --> 01:50:11,199
Thoran said in an SNN it was number 36

2017
01:50:08,159 --> 01:50:13,600
last week last Monday. He said something

2018
01:50:11,199 --> 01:50:19,119
very very very important. He said no it

2019
01:50:13,600 --> 01:50:22,080
was in 35th. Oh yes. He said

2020
01:50:19,119 --> 01:50:26,320
it is not this the great reveal that

2021
01:50:22,080 --> 01:50:28,719
will set you free but your endeavors to

2022
01:50:26,320 --> 01:50:30,719
set yourselves free that will allow the

2023
01:50:28,719 --> 01:50:32,560
great reveal that will bring the great

2024
01:50:30,719 --> 01:50:34,639
reveal.

2025
01:50:32,560 --> 01:50:38,320
And the following morning, Julian Asen

2026
01:50:34,639 --> 01:50:41,440
was liberated. So I think he's

2027
01:50:38,320 --> 01:50:44,440
he was mentioning this as well. I'm

2028
01:50:41,440 --> 01:50:44,440
sure.

2029
01:50:45,040 --> 01:50:52,719
So uh is time really speeding up? A

2030
01:50:48,320 --> 01:50:54,800
question from Yenna Spiro. Um

2031
01:50:52,719 --> 01:50:57,840
yes, because we are moving into the

2032
01:50:54,800 --> 01:51:01,119
fifth density. So

2033
01:50:57,840 --> 01:51:05,440
the the galaxy is the time of the galaxy

2034
01:51:01,119 --> 01:51:08,960
is faster than on earth third density.

2035
01:51:05,440 --> 01:51:13,199
So we are we have entered in this fifth

2036
01:51:08,960 --> 01:51:16,159
density zone area in the galaxy. We've

2037
01:51:13,199 --> 01:51:19,040
left our third density

2038
01:51:16,159 --> 01:51:21,360
black mesh whole thing and we've moved

2039
01:51:19,040 --> 01:51:23,679
into this density, this fifth density.

2040
01:51:21,360 --> 01:51:26,159
And now the the star system is really

2041
01:51:23,679 --> 01:51:29,040
calibrating and it comes always from the

2042
01:51:26,159 --> 01:51:32,159
stars. So have you noticed how the the

2043
01:51:29,040 --> 01:51:34,800
star the sun has changed from yellow to

2044
01:51:32,159 --> 01:51:36,480
white recent in the recent years

2045
01:51:34,800 --> 01:51:38,000
decades.

2046
01:51:36,480 --> 01:51:40,560
Um

2047
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:44,000
when we were a kid we were drawing the

2048
01:51:40,560 --> 01:51:47,040
sun and yellow you know coloring in

2049
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:50,719
yellow. Now it's white. It's really

2050
01:51:47,040 --> 01:51:53,440
white. Slightly yellow golden but white.

2051
01:51:50,719 --> 01:51:56,719
We are moving into the fifth density and

2052
01:51:53,440 --> 01:52:01,599
so the time is experienced experienced

2053
01:51:56,719 --> 01:52:05,440
faster as I explained earlier on

2054
01:52:01,599 --> 01:52:08,840
with 31 vote car

2055
01:52:05,440 --> 01:52:08,840
how are you

2056
01:52:08,880 --> 01:52:14,880
um hena if Thoran and yourself is from

2057
01:52:11,679 --> 01:52:16,960
dark future 300 years old um from now

2058
01:52:14,880 --> 01:52:19,360
does it create a time paradox when he

2059
01:52:16,960 --> 01:52:21,360
returns to the future I've oh I've I've

2060
01:52:19,360 --> 01:52:24,480
answered this one. I've answered this

2061
01:52:21,360 --> 01:52:29,599
one, Carl. So, you've got your answer uh

2062
01:52:24,480 --> 01:52:33,760
earlier on. Um question 29 from AA

2063
01:52:29,599 --> 01:52:35,440
Louise Carter. Hello, Aina. Hi, you have

2064
01:52:33,760 --> 01:52:38,880
mentioned the importance of the prime

2065
01:52:35,440 --> 01:52:42,000
directive, but why were why sorry, why

2066
01:52:38,880 --> 01:52:44,159
were so many ET colonies like the Ail or

2067
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:46,480
Celuzi allowed to settle here and

2068
01:52:44,159 --> 01:52:50,000
interbread with us? Doesn't this go

2069
01:52:46,480 --> 01:52:51,840
against the law of non-inference? So

2070
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:55,119
it was done regarding the prime

2071
01:52:51,840 --> 01:52:59,840
directive when the the the ail and the

2072
01:52:55,119 --> 01:53:03,199
celuzi came here it was in the program

2073
01:52:59,840 --> 01:53:05,599
of collaboration of the earth alliance

2074
01:53:03,199 --> 01:53:08,000
to collaborate on technologies. So it

2075
01:53:05,599 --> 01:53:10,639
was all

2076
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:16,639
inside of a frame, you know, inside of

2077
01:53:10,639 --> 01:53:18,880
um um a program, an operation. And so it

2078
01:53:16,639 --> 01:53:21,440
was not a bridge of the prime directive

2079
01:53:18,880 --> 01:53:24,000
because it was in an operation to save a

2080
01:53:21,440 --> 01:53:27,000
world. So that's that's the the

2081
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:27,000
difference.

2082
01:53:28,239 --> 01:53:34,560
247 votes

2083
01:53:30,880 --> 01:53:36,400
and you are enlightenment bell. How are

2084
01:53:34,560 --> 01:53:39,040
you?

2085
01:53:36,400 --> 01:53:42,560
How are you?

2086
01:53:39,040 --> 01:53:44,880
So your question is, dear Elena, as it

2087
01:53:42,560 --> 01:53:47,119
is said, time is not linear. Past,

2088
01:53:44,880 --> 01:53:50,080
present, and future all exist at the

2089
01:53:47,119 --> 01:53:52,000
same time. Is it possible for each of us

2090
01:53:50,080 --> 01:53:54,560
as a fractal of source to go back

2091
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:57,599
through consciousness to a past time

2092
01:53:54,560 --> 01:53:59,760
point of a linear timeline to change a

2093
01:53:57,599 --> 01:54:02,320
regretful decision made at that time

2094
01:53:59,760 --> 01:54:05,040
point? How will it affect our present

2095
01:54:02,320 --> 01:54:08,000
life? much love and gratitude. You can

2096
01:54:05,040 --> 01:54:10,320
do it by physical time travel. You can

2097
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:12,080
do it.

2098
01:54:10,320 --> 01:54:14,480
You can interface your consciousness

2099
01:54:12,080 --> 01:54:17,760
with your own personal consciousness at

2100
01:54:14,480 --> 01:54:19,360
that moment in time in the quantum time

2101
01:54:17,760 --> 01:54:22,320
field.

2102
01:54:19,360 --> 01:54:24,320
But that will not really affect your

2103
01:54:22,320 --> 01:54:27,199
actions.

2104
01:54:24,320 --> 01:54:30,000
You need to really physically go back at

2105
01:54:27,199 --> 01:54:32,320
that point and change the past. What

2106
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:37,920
happens as I explained the timeline just

2107
01:54:32,320 --> 01:54:41,880
stops existing the story line I'd say.

2108
01:54:37,920 --> 01:54:41,880
So here we go.

2109
01:54:42,080 --> 01:54:48,080
Andrew Maisy 29 votes.

2110
01:54:45,920 --> 01:54:52,639
Anax

2111
01:54:48,080 --> 01:54:55,280
says time is a bubble where all moments

2112
01:54:52,639 --> 01:54:57,440
are equidistant from eternity. How

2113
01:54:55,280 --> 01:55:01,280
beautiful description of the quantum

2114
01:54:57,440 --> 01:55:05,199
time field. So there are many nows and

2115
01:55:01,280 --> 01:55:07,440
or everything is happening at once. Yes.

2116
01:55:05,199 --> 01:55:09,679
But if so, what is the reference point

2117
01:55:07,440 --> 01:55:13,520
for a particular now to be able to

2118
01:55:09,679 --> 01:55:15,040
travel there? Please elaborate.

2119
01:55:13,520 --> 01:55:16,800
Um

2120
01:55:15,040 --> 01:55:19,679
what is the reference point for a

2121
01:55:16,800 --> 01:55:21,920
particular now to be able to Okay.

2122
01:55:19,679 --> 01:55:27,159
evolution progress

2123
01:55:21,920 --> 01:55:27,159
the Fibonacci sequence of evolution

2124
01:55:28,320 --> 01:55:32,960
there are story lines the story line of

2125
01:55:30,960 --> 01:55:35,199
your journey that is a progressive

2126
01:55:32,960 --> 01:55:36,960
evolution

2127
01:55:35,199 --> 01:55:39,920
a progressive

2128
01:55:36,960 --> 01:55:42,080
golden mean

2129
01:55:39,920 --> 01:55:46,000
and

2130
01:55:42,080 --> 01:55:49,119
um that's how I could um

2131
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:51,119
describe all the points or the numbers

2132
01:55:49,119 --> 01:55:54,960
being linked to each other on this line

2133
01:55:51,119 --> 01:55:57,679
of the Fibonacci sequence the golden

2134
01:55:54,960 --> 01:56:01,119
mean you have all the points and it's

2135
01:55:57,679 --> 01:56:03,760
not a timeline it's a story line I

2136
01:56:01,119 --> 01:56:06,760
cannot describe it better than this

2137
01:56:03,760 --> 01:56:06,760
though

2138
01:56:08,080 --> 01:56:11,800
question 28

2139
01:56:17,040 --> 01:56:24,199
Um from

2140
01:56:20,080 --> 01:56:24,199
hello Christine Louie.

2141
01:56:24,880 --> 01:56:29,840
Oh it's a long one. Elena I practice

2142
01:56:27,679 --> 01:56:32,000
energy healing and my question is when I

2143
01:56:29,840 --> 01:56:35,119
use myself as a channel for divine

2144
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:37,840
energy to go to the person on the

2145
01:56:35,119 --> 01:56:41,119
quantum or distant healing. Can I go

2146
01:56:37,840 --> 01:56:43,679
back in time? For example, a few days

2147
01:56:41,119 --> 01:56:45,520
before the person got an infection so I

2148
01:56:43,679 --> 01:56:48,480
can perform the healing on the cut to

2149
01:56:45,520 --> 01:56:52,239
prevent the present infection.

2150
01:56:48,480 --> 01:56:54,800
Yes, that's how the medical beds work.

2151
01:56:52,239 --> 01:56:56,560
Um,

2152
01:56:54,800 --> 01:56:58,880
you

2153
01:56:56,560 --> 01:57:00,880
tune into the hologram of the person. If

2154
01:56:58,880 --> 01:57:06,040
it's not by technology, it's by your

2155
01:57:00,880 --> 01:57:06,040
consciousness as you did. And

2156
01:57:07,040 --> 01:57:15,440
you are going to regress, rewind,

2157
01:57:11,840 --> 01:57:17,599
rewind the hologram until the moment it

2158
01:57:15,440 --> 01:57:20,080
was not infected. For instance, a wound

2159
01:57:17,599 --> 01:57:22,560
was not infected. And you just imprint

2160
01:57:20,080 --> 01:57:24,800
it and anchor it in the body. You take

2161
01:57:22,560 --> 01:57:26,639
this vision, this holographic vision,

2162
01:57:24,800 --> 01:57:30,239
and you imprint it in the body. You

2163
01:57:26,639 --> 01:57:33,840
superimpose it to the sick body and the

2164
01:57:30,239 --> 01:57:37,360
universe tends to perfection as we know

2165
01:57:33,840 --> 01:57:41,760
it. The the the infection will that is

2166
01:57:37,360 --> 01:57:46,560
dissolent will be dis dissolved and sees

2167
01:57:41,760 --> 01:57:49,520
will merge into resonance so will heal

2168
01:57:46,560 --> 01:57:52,880
when you superimpose the resonant

2169
01:57:49,520 --> 01:57:55,280
version of the body on it.

2170
01:57:52,880 --> 01:57:57,760
So that's what's going to it's going to

2171
01:57:55,280 --> 01:57:57,760
happen.

2172
01:57:57,920 --> 01:58:01,639
So um

2173
01:58:03,440 --> 01:58:11,119
obviously you did it and it worked. Uh

2174
01:58:06,480 --> 01:58:13,360
what I can read. So well done. See,

2175
01:58:11,119 --> 01:58:15,920
thank you Elena and Princia in advance

2176
01:58:13,360 --> 01:58:18,320
to if you can say something. I think

2177
01:58:15,920 --> 01:58:20,400
we're going to be good.

2178
01:58:18,320 --> 01:58:22,400
Thank you Christine.

2179
01:58:20,400 --> 01:58:25,280
So yes, you can do it and you you've

2180
01:58:22,400 --> 01:58:27,520
done it. It worked. So that's the way to

2181
01:58:25,280 --> 01:58:31,199
go.

2182
01:58:27,520 --> 01:58:33,840
Question from Jane Hernandez.

2183
01:58:31,199 --> 01:58:37,040
Hello Elena. Which ET race create the

2184
01:58:33,840 --> 01:58:38,960
time construct here on Terra? Will the

2185
01:58:37,040 --> 01:58:40,719
perception of time change when Terra

2186
01:58:38,960 --> 01:58:43,360
sense? Thank you for all you do to

2187
01:58:40,719 --> 01:58:47,679
educate and keep us informed.

2188
01:58:43,360 --> 01:58:50,800
There's no iterates time. Time has never

2189
01:58:47,679 --> 01:58:52,800
been created and will never seize. It's

2190
01:58:50,800 --> 01:58:56,639
the field

2191
01:58:52,800 --> 01:58:59,599
and no one created it. It's it was there

2192
01:58:56,639 --> 01:59:02,239
to be there. That's very difficult to

2193
01:58:59,599 --> 01:59:08,599
encompass this notion of never born,

2194
01:59:02,239 --> 01:59:08,599
never die, but that's how it is.

2195
01:59:09,920 --> 01:59:14,719
And yes, the perception of time of

2196
01:59:11,920 --> 01:59:16,880
course accelerates as we go higher

2197
01:59:14,719 --> 01:59:20,880
densities.

2198
01:59:16,880 --> 01:59:23,760
This matter vibrates faster.

2199
01:59:20,880 --> 01:59:25,679
Question from Moj Kendrick. Dear Elena,

2200
01:59:23,760 --> 01:59:28,560
do you think we exist as previous

2201
01:59:25,679 --> 01:59:31,040
incarnations of ourselves or does each

2202
01:59:28,560 --> 01:59:33,119
incarnation end like a book that cannot

2203
01:59:31,040 --> 01:59:35,119
be changed?

2204
01:59:33,119 --> 01:59:37,520
So yes, we exist as previous

2205
01:59:35,119 --> 01:59:42,199
incarnations of ourselves in the quantum

2206
01:59:37,520 --> 01:59:42,199
time field simultaneously.

2207
01:59:42,639 --> 01:59:47,040
And

2208
01:59:44,480 --> 01:59:50,320
you can change the book, rewrite the

2209
01:59:47,040 --> 01:59:53,840
book if you have a physical pen.

2210
01:59:50,320 --> 01:59:56,800
You go physically in the past to rewrite

2211
01:59:53,840 --> 01:59:59,599
the book.

2212
01:59:56,800 --> 02:00:02,000
And that goes against the ethic of the

2213
01:59:59,599 --> 02:00:05,159
universal laws, but it's can be done

2214
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:05,159
with technology.

2215
02:00:09,599 --> 02:00:15,400
Question from Josephine.

2216
02:00:17,920 --> 02:00:22,000
Do many star seeds or voice come from

2217
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:24,239
the future like you and Toran? And by

2218
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:25,760
what process can a soul incarnate in the

2219
02:00:24,239 --> 02:00:27,599
past?

2220
02:00:25,760 --> 02:00:30,639
Oh, I've answered these questions,

2221
02:00:27,599 --> 02:00:32,320
Josephine. So, um I'm going to pass the

2222
02:00:30,639 --> 02:00:34,639
other ones. Lucky I've answered them

2223
02:00:32,320 --> 02:00:37,360
already. We're going to go fast.

2224
02:00:34,639 --> 02:00:39,040
Um,

2225
02:00:37,360 --> 02:00:41,280
Mo,

2226
02:00:39,040 --> 02:00:44,080
hey

2227
02:00:41,280 --> 02:00:46,880
Mo. Oh, I'm so glad. Oh, I miss you so

2228
02:00:44,080 --> 02:00:49,360
much. You know, Moenu, your the curator

2229
02:00:46,880 --> 02:00:51,280
of the the conference in Tokyo, which

2230
02:00:49,360 --> 02:00:54,880
was absolutely amazing. I was treated

2231
02:00:51,280 --> 02:00:56,239
like um an empress. Um,

2232
02:00:54,880 --> 02:00:58,880
Japanese people are so beautiful.

2233
02:00:56,239 --> 02:01:02,480
Anyway, dear beautiful Elena, I would

2234
02:00:58,880 --> 02:01:04,480
like to know if we can time travel. Then

2235
02:01:02,480 --> 02:01:07,599
what happens when we physically meet

2236
02:01:04,480 --> 02:01:09,920
ourselves in the future or in the past?

2237
02:01:07,599 --> 02:01:13,360
Can we give some advice to ourselves for

2238
02:01:09,920 --> 02:01:16,239
the decision uh that we are making at

2239
02:01:13,360 --> 02:01:18,960
that time and change the outcome? Thank

2240
02:01:16,239 --> 02:01:22,639
you for all your love and all you do for

2241
02:01:18,960 --> 02:01:26,639
the humanity. Love from Japan Myoko. Oh,

2242
02:01:22,639 --> 02:01:29,199
I love you so much. Um

2243
02:01:26,639 --> 02:01:31,440
we can ch we can travel in time

2244
02:01:29,199 --> 02:01:35,199
physically. We can also and change the

2245
02:01:31,440 --> 02:01:37,520
outcome. We can also interface our

2246
02:01:35,199 --> 02:01:39,199
consciousness to the consciousness of

2247
02:01:37,520 --> 02:01:45,080
ourselves

2248
02:01:39,199 --> 02:01:45,080
in a previous life and try to

2249
02:01:45,280 --> 02:01:51,920
influence influence. It's very difficult

2250
02:01:48,560 --> 02:01:54,320
very very very difficult to access to go

2251
02:01:51,920 --> 02:01:56,480
through all the layers of consciousness

2252
02:01:54,320 --> 02:02:00,080
throughout the the thinking mind of the

2253
02:01:56,480 --> 02:02:02,960
person. It's possible

2254
02:02:00,080 --> 02:02:05,040
uh but there it's so difficult because

2255
02:02:02,960 --> 02:02:08,080
the universe has you know time has its

2256
02:02:05,040 --> 02:02:10,159
own safety locks

2257
02:02:08,080 --> 02:02:12,719
um you know sometimes you can dream of

2258
02:02:10,159 --> 02:02:15,920
yourself in the future you know um Danny

2259
02:02:12,719 --> 02:02:19,040
Henderson um tells this story and it's I

2260
02:02:15,920 --> 02:02:20,800
think it's in her book u angels in moons

2261
02:02:19,040 --> 02:02:23,360
and aliens or if it's not it will be

2262
02:02:20,800 --> 02:02:26,639
surely in the the next one when her

2263
02:02:23,360 --> 02:02:28,960
future self materializes as a hologram

2264
02:02:26,639 --> 02:02:32,080
I'm transplant at the in front of her

2265
02:02:28,960 --> 02:02:34,000
bed and uh she's beautiful. She's a

2266
02:02:32,080 --> 02:02:37,840
plleadian and she's she's and she's

2267
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:41,840
there and she's telling her guidance and

2268
02:02:37,840 --> 02:02:44,239
um she's telling her things um advice.

2269
02:02:41,840 --> 02:02:46,560
So you can you can do this if you're

2270
02:02:44,239 --> 02:02:48,719
really skilled. You can project

2271
02:02:46,560 --> 02:02:51,040
yourself, but it's very hard. The best

2272
02:02:48,719 --> 02:02:53,280
way to in to

2273
02:02:51,040 --> 02:02:55,199
surely and safely and easily modify the

2274
02:02:53,280 --> 02:02:57,840
past is to go there physically with

2275
02:02:55,199 --> 02:02:57,840
technology.

2276
02:02:59,599 --> 02:03:07,280
Thank you, Mo. Have a nice day.

2277
02:03:04,400 --> 02:03:09,760
23. Radu

2278
02:03:07,280 --> 02:03:12,480

books signed copies. So anyways, Radu,

2287
02:03:35,440 --> 02:03:40,800
what happens if you die during the 20

2288
02:03:37,840 --> 02:03:42,960
and back programs? Oh, good question.

2289
02:03:40,800 --> 02:03:45,040
Does your soul return to the original

2290
02:03:42,960 --> 02:03:48,159
point where you were taken out of your

2291
02:03:45,040 --> 02:03:50,000
body? Tony Rodrig's soul return after

2292
02:03:48,159 --> 02:03:53,360
committing suicide, but that was a

2293
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:55,040
different technology. Thank you.

2294
02:03:53,360 --> 02:03:57,920
No matter the technology, no matter the

2295
02:03:55,040 --> 02:03:59,599
the species and where you are when you

2296
02:03:57,920 --> 02:04:04,480
that's that's a way of ending the

2297
02:03:59,599 --> 02:04:08,719
program. But um you suffer tremendously

2298
02:04:04,480 --> 02:04:12,000
you know um suicide the condition when

2299
02:04:08,719 --> 02:04:13,679
it happens it's

2300
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:15,440
it

2301
02:04:13,679 --> 02:04:18,000
strain your soul. It's really the the

2302
02:04:15,440 --> 02:04:20,239
the the travel back is is strainous.

2303
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:23,040
It's it's difficult you know but you

2304
02:04:20,239 --> 02:04:28,480
eventually go back to the the point when

2305
02:04:23,040 --> 02:04:32,560
you were taken when you started the the

2306
02:04:28,480 --> 02:04:36,080
journey. So um

2307
02:04:32,560 --> 02:04:38,800
I am sure of this and it worked for Tony

2308
02:04:36,080 --> 02:04:42,199
you know. So

2309
02:04:38,800 --> 02:04:42,199
thank you Ru.

2310
02:04:42,960 --> 02:04:48,719
Um, next question with 22 votes from

2311
02:04:46,400 --> 02:04:51,719
Marijana

2312
02:04:48,719 --> 02:04:51,719
Marijuana.

2313
02:04:54,400 --> 02:04:59,520
Alex Kolier had a recent guest Rob

2314
02:04:57,920 --> 02:05:01,360
Potter.

2315
02:04:59,520 --> 02:05:03,599
Okay.

2316
02:05:01,360 --> 02:05:08,159
Who stated that he received a message

2317
02:05:03,599 --> 02:05:10,000
from the Queen of Venus.

2318
02:05:08,159 --> 02:05:14,000
What are your thoughts about it? Thank

2319
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:14,000
you for all you do.

2320
02:05:14,880 --> 02:05:17,880
Okay.

2321
02:05:23,520 --> 02:05:30,080
There is no queen on Venus.

2322
02:05:26,080 --> 02:05:32,320
There is no queen on Venus. It's um

2323
02:05:30,080 --> 02:05:36,800
planet with federate. It's a federated

2324
02:05:32,320 --> 02:05:40,080
cities system. You have

2325
02:05:36,800 --> 02:05:42,960
underground cities that are of

2326
02:05:40,080 --> 02:05:46,800
Talenturans

2327
02:05:42,960 --> 02:05:48,400
um different races and they all

2328
02:05:46,800 --> 02:05:51,280
federated

2329
02:05:48,400 --> 02:05:52,960
under the the leadership not the

2330
02:05:51,280 --> 02:05:54,719
leadership the I don't like this word

2331
02:05:52,960 --> 02:05:57,599
and it's not the case under the

2332
02:05:54,719 --> 02:06:01,119
management of and the administration of

2333
02:05:57,599 --> 02:06:03,679
the council of al-Nam

2334
02:06:01,119 --> 02:06:07,920
the Galactic Federation of Worlds

2335
02:06:03,679 --> 02:06:09,440
is there as sorry as well.

2336
02:06:07,920 --> 02:06:13,480
There are also all members of the

2337
02:06:09,440 --> 02:06:13,480
Galactic Federation of Worlds,

2338
02:06:13,840 --> 02:06:17,440
but there is no royalty. There is no

2339
02:06:15,760 --> 02:06:19,760
queen.

2340
02:06:17,440 --> 02:06:22,960
There's no queen on Venus.

2341
02:06:19,760 --> 02:06:26,800
I've been there twice and I know this.

2342
02:06:22,960 --> 02:06:29,520
Um, you know, in my work, I

2343
02:06:26,800 --> 02:06:32,239
I go to meetings sometimes and I meet

2344
02:06:29,520 --> 02:06:34,159
with diplomats and I meet with sometimes

2345
02:06:32,239 --> 02:06:37,280
Valthor.

2346
02:06:34,159 --> 02:06:39,440
I'm It's not my personal contact. Valor,

2347
02:06:37,280 --> 02:06:41,840
it's just someone I meet in my work

2348
02:06:39,440 --> 02:06:43,520
sometimes, but that's all. And he's very

2349
02:06:41,840 --> 02:06:45,440
distant.

2350
02:06:43,520 --> 02:06:47,440
Valor doesn't communicate with

2351
02:06:45,440 --> 02:06:51,280
civilians.

2352
02:06:47,440 --> 02:06:52,719
Uh, he's an ambassador.

2353
02:06:51,280 --> 02:06:54,560
It's the difference with an emissary is

2354
02:06:52,719 --> 02:06:56,960
an ambassador. An ambassador works at

2355
02:06:54,560 --> 02:07:00,159
government levels with official

2356
02:06:56,960 --> 02:07:02,400
government officials is not is no time

2357
02:07:00,159 --> 02:07:05,840
for the public.

2358
02:07:02,400 --> 02:07:08,400
Um that's his work. Okay. because of the

2359
02:07:05,840 --> 02:07:10,560
classified of his work and secrecy of

2360
02:07:08,400 --> 02:07:12,480
his work.

2361
02:07:10,560 --> 02:07:15,119
There's a lot of people pretending to

2362
02:07:12,480 --> 02:07:18,719
talk to him or

2363
02:07:15,119 --> 02:07:22,079
being him, opening um YouTube channels

2364
02:07:18,719 --> 02:07:24,239
or even pretending being him. I've

2365
02:07:22,079 --> 02:07:25,599
covered this already, but regarding the

2366
02:07:24,239 --> 02:07:28,800
queen of Venus, there's no queen on

2367
02:07:25,599 --> 02:07:30,719
Venus and everything going around this

2368
02:07:28,800 --> 02:07:33,520
Queen of Venus thing, all the the the

2369
02:07:30,719 --> 02:07:37,199
the

2370
02:07:33,520 --> 02:07:40,400
Earth ladies with red barretts and a lot

2371
02:07:37,199 --> 02:07:43,679
of makeup and and and they're not

2372
02:07:40,400 --> 02:07:47,280
Venuians. The whole thing is a scam and

2373
02:07:43,679 --> 02:07:49,199
it's someone's story. I've been in

2374
02:07:47,280 --> 02:07:51,679
contact with this this person and his

2375
02:07:49,199 --> 02:07:55,280
hacky and um I have to say I've seen for

2376
02:07:51,679 --> 02:07:57,679
myself. I've listened to them

2377
02:07:55,280 --> 02:08:02,800
and I felt the frequency. I've listened

2378
02:07:57,679 --> 02:08:05,360
to them and um I told them

2379
02:08:02,800 --> 02:08:08,480
um it doesn't work with me. I have other

2380
02:08:05,360 --> 02:08:10,880
information. It's not what I I was shown

2381
02:08:08,480 --> 02:08:14,000
physically. It's not the place where

2382
02:08:10,880 --> 02:08:18,480
I've been. It's sorry. So we're friends

2383
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:20,159
but that's it. So, you know, there's no

2384
02:08:18,480 --> 02:08:22,320
point. There was never a point to say

2385
02:08:20,159 --> 02:08:25,040
anything. But, um, if you ask the

2386
02:08:22,320 --> 02:08:29,920
question, there's no queen on Venus.

2387
02:08:25,040 --> 02:08:33,360
Um, and whatever these people are

2388
02:08:29,920 --> 02:08:36,159
spreading as

2389
02:08:33,360 --> 02:08:39,920
stupid things about me and

2390
02:08:36,159 --> 02:08:41,360
a weekend or whatever. Um,

2391
02:08:39,920 --> 02:08:44,079
it's because they want to protect a

2392
02:08:41,360 --> 02:08:48,159
business. That's all. So, um, that's my

2393
02:08:44,079 --> 02:08:50,400
answer. It's very harsh. But um

2394
02:08:48,159 --> 02:08:52,159
my job is not an easy job. I'm not doing

2395
02:08:50,400 --> 02:08:54,159
this job to be popular. I'm doing this

2396
02:08:52,159 --> 02:08:56,000
job to

2397
02:08:54,159 --> 02:08:58,639
and to make friends. I'm doing this job

2398
02:08:56,000 --> 02:09:00,400
to

2399
02:08:58,639 --> 02:09:04,400
for the mission and to tell the truth.

2400
02:09:00,400 --> 02:09:07,880
So that's my knowledge.

2401
02:09:04,400 --> 02:09:07,880
There's no queen.

2402
02:09:09,040 --> 02:09:14,520
So

2403
02:09:11,199 --> 02:09:14,520
next question.

2404
02:09:17,599 --> 02:09:23,440
Okay. Um,

2405
02:09:20,560 --> 02:09:28,599
do the andromedans descend from the

2406
02:09:23,440 --> 02:09:28,599
tile? Oh, David. Um,

2407
02:09:29,360 --> 02:09:34,480
they were at the origin

2408
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:38,880
a tal human race, but that they've

2409
02:09:34,480 --> 02:09:42,320
migrated so much so much so much. They

2410
02:09:38,880 --> 02:09:44,079
they arrived on Titawin in the

2411
02:09:42,320 --> 02:09:47,599
uh Andromeda constellation the star

2412
02:09:44,079 --> 02:09:52,400
system Titawin and after a long period

2413
02:09:47,599 --> 02:09:54,159
of migrating and transforming

2414
02:09:52,400 --> 02:09:57,199
interbreeding with species and they're

2415
02:09:54,159 --> 02:10:00,560
now the beautiful tall blue humans they

2416
02:09:57,199 --> 02:10:03,360
are they are absolutely magnificent um

2417
02:10:00,560 --> 02:10:06,239
I've met some and some zenate on board

2418
02:10:03,360 --> 02:10:10,079
the excelsure I haven't spoken to them

2419
02:10:06,239 --> 02:10:14,159
and I could see I I mean, wow. They are

2420
02:10:10,079 --> 02:10:19,119
really thin and and elegant and they

2421
02:10:14,159 --> 02:10:20,719
walk like this with grace and you know

2422
02:10:19,119 --> 02:10:23,280
slow and they're really really

2423
02:10:20,719 --> 02:10:25,760
beautiful. So, but I've never interacted

2424
02:10:23,280 --> 02:10:29,880
with one. Yeah, they're really really

2425
02:10:25,760 --> 02:10:29,880
nice pe beautiful people.

2426
02:10:31,840 --> 02:10:39,560
Uh, next question from Bellana WGA.

2427
02:10:40,480 --> 02:10:48,400
Um, inter species time, space, time.

2428
02:10:45,360 --> 02:10:50,320
Dear fellow warrior,

2429
02:10:48,400 --> 02:10:53,280
as far as I understand, time is a

2430
02:10:50,320 --> 02:10:56,719
different measurement for each species.

2431
02:10:53,280 --> 02:11:00,320
Is there a fixed space time? If so, how

2432
02:10:56,719 --> 02:11:02,239
is it defined? Constell no does uh

2433
02:11:00,320 --> 02:11:04,960
constellations in relation to each

2434
02:11:02,239 --> 02:11:07,280
other. If so is there is still the

2435
02:11:04,960 --> 02:11:09,360
perspective for exact definition. How do

2436
02:11:07,280 --> 02:11:13,199
you make appointments without causing a

2437
02:11:09,360 --> 02:11:15,440
complete mess? They fearless iris.

2438
02:11:13,199 --> 02:11:18,239
I don't understand exactly everything

2439
02:11:15,440 --> 02:11:20,960
you say but

2440
02:11:18,239 --> 02:11:25,440
why is the question in there?

2441
02:11:20,960 --> 02:11:28,440
Is there a fixed spaceime? No spacetime.

2442
02:11:25,440 --> 02:11:28,440
Okay.

2443
02:11:28,719 --> 02:11:33,520
The continuum of spaceime is infinite

2444
02:11:31,520 --> 02:11:35,920
and eternal. It's a flow. And it's a

2445
02:11:33,520 --> 02:11:38,239
flow because it's the evolution. It's

2446
02:11:35,920 --> 02:11:41,360
constant move. And in this constant

2447
02:11:38,239 --> 02:11:43,520
move, you have fight for balance also

2448
02:11:41,360 --> 02:11:46,480
between creation and destruction. And

2449
02:11:43,520 --> 02:11:50,400
creation is always

2450
02:11:46,480 --> 02:11:53,119
winning a little bit pulling it. The

2451
02:11:50,400 --> 02:11:57,440
universe is in constant creation in

2452
02:11:53,119 --> 02:11:59,599
constant progress progression evolution

2453
02:11:57,440 --> 02:12:04,199
golden mean.

2454
02:11:59,599 --> 02:12:04,199
So there's not fixed time.

2455
02:12:04,320 --> 02:12:07,320
Um

2456
02:12:08,480 --> 02:12:14,560
and I think interfering between points

2457
02:12:11,840 --> 02:12:17,599
without causing a mess uh you need to

2458
02:12:14,560 --> 02:12:20,560
respect the laws of the universe and um

2459
02:12:17,599 --> 02:12:23,520
not advised to travel in time. Listen

2460
02:12:20,560 --> 02:12:26,320
you know why travel in time to fix a

2461
02:12:23,520 --> 02:12:28,880
mistake

2462
02:12:26,320 --> 02:12:30,400
when the universe is all about

2463
02:12:28,880 --> 02:12:35,599
evolution.

2464
02:12:30,400 --> 02:12:39,440
You make mistake for a reason to learn

2465
02:12:35,599 --> 02:12:41,520
and to become better to become more

2466
02:12:39,440 --> 02:12:44,960
clever.

2467
02:12:41,520 --> 02:12:49,040
Develop your instinct, your intelligence

2468
02:12:44,960 --> 02:12:53,280
that when you are confronted to the same

2469
02:12:49,040 --> 02:12:56,079
uh challenge, you succeed this challenge

2470
02:12:53,280 --> 02:12:58,239
and you take the right decision. Why

2471
02:12:56,079 --> 02:13:00,239
coming to the past to raise our

2472
02:12:58,239 --> 02:13:03,920
mistakes?

2473
02:13:00,239 --> 02:13:07,679
um you know, okay, you can go to the

2474
02:13:03,920 --> 02:13:09,199
past to stop a murder,

2475
02:13:07,679 --> 02:13:12,000
does something that's really

2476
02:13:09,199 --> 02:13:13,840
understandable, but then

2477
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:17,440
the person who lives who should have

2478
02:13:13,840 --> 02:13:19,920
died, maybe she does something bad, you

2479
02:13:17,440 --> 02:13:23,320
know, she you you don't know. It's all a

2480
02:13:19,920 --> 02:13:23,320
question of perspective.

2481
02:13:26,320 --> 02:13:31,840
Um, I try to go fast in the questions

2482
02:13:28,719 --> 02:13:37,079
then I can answer as much as possible.

2483
02:13:31,840 --> 02:13:37,079
45 minutes. Okay, we we get this.

2484
02:13:37,360 --> 02:13:43,280
Um, Marott,

2485
02:13:40,560 --> 02:13:44,880
how are you? Try it.

2486
02:13:43,280 --> 02:13:46,880
Dear Elena, thank you for your

2487
02:13:44,880 --> 02:13:49,760
dedication to help us better understand

2488
02:13:46,880 --> 02:13:53,119
life. Since

2489
02:13:49,760 --> 02:13:55,679
it is the gravity of the planets that

2490
02:13:53,119 --> 02:13:59,040
generates time,

2491
02:13:55,679 --> 02:14:01,599
how do the ETS regulate their circadian

2492
02:13:59,040 --> 02:14:03,360
rhythm? Oh, that's great. When they are

2493
02:14:01,599 --> 02:14:05,440
on a ship that is not on the same

2494
02:14:03,360 --> 02:14:08,639
gravity as their home world or when they

2495
02:14:05,440 --> 02:14:10,560
have to go to many planets regularly.

2496
02:14:08,639 --> 02:14:14,960
Such

2497
02:14:10,560 --> 02:14:18,320
uh uh oh your question has disappeared.

2498
02:14:14,960 --> 02:14:23,360
That's really weird.

2499
02:14:18,320 --> 02:14:25,760
Oh, sorry. I got it. Um

2500
02:14:23,360 --> 02:14:28,480
as or when they have to go to many

2501
02:14:25,760 --> 02:14:30,079
planets regularly such as ambassadors.

2502
02:14:28,480 --> 02:14:32,159
Okay.

2503
02:14:30,079 --> 02:14:34,239
I love this question and I'm so glad you

2504
02:14:32,159 --> 02:14:38,440
asked it, Marott, because that's a great

2505
02:14:34,239 --> 02:14:38,440
question. Um

2506
02:14:38,800 --> 02:14:44,560
okay

2507
02:14:40,960 --> 02:14:47,520
you are from a certain planetary matrix

2508
02:14:44,560 --> 02:14:50,719
you have your own circadian circle you

2509
02:14:47,520 --> 02:14:52,239
cycle sorry of day and night and so

2510
02:14:50,719 --> 02:14:54,239
that's your biology that's your

2511
02:14:52,239 --> 02:14:56,880
metabolism and you need to respect it to

2512
02:14:54,239 --> 02:14:59,840
be remain healthy.

2513
02:14:56,880 --> 02:15:03,040
So your

2514
02:14:59,840 --> 02:15:05,280
best solution is to go travel on a ship

2515
02:15:03,040 --> 02:15:08,159
with crew members who have the same

2516
02:15:05,280 --> 02:15:11,360
psychicadian circle as you. It's not

2517
02:15:08,159 --> 02:15:14,320
always the case. So I've seen that in

2518
02:15:11,360 --> 02:15:16,400
the federation they respect each other's

2519
02:15:14,320 --> 02:15:18,400
cycle

2520
02:15:16,400 --> 02:15:20,800
and

2521
02:15:18,400 --> 02:15:23,040
the person will go to sleep and rest

2522
02:15:20,800 --> 02:15:25,360
when according to their cycles from

2523
02:15:23,040 --> 02:15:27,199
their own planet and then they remain

2524
02:15:25,360 --> 02:15:29,040
healthy.

2525
02:15:27,199 --> 02:15:31,840
because they're not going to have jet

2526
02:15:29,040 --> 02:15:36,079
lag constantly, you know. So, wherever

2527
02:15:31,840 --> 02:15:37,599
you go, you still are on your

2528
02:15:36,079 --> 02:15:40,239
psychicadian

2529
02:15:37,599 --> 02:15:42,079
circle cycle.

2530
02:15:40,239 --> 02:15:46,159
Um,

2531
02:15:42,079 --> 02:15:50,400
and so are the ambassadors, you know.

2532
02:15:46,159 --> 02:15:53,400
Um, so that's that's it really. That's

2533
02:15:50,400 --> 02:15:53,400
it.

2534
02:15:55,199 --> 02:16:02,480
Arisism librarian. Hello. How are you?

2535
02:16:00,079 --> 02:16:04,800
Thank you for all your hard work, Elena.

2536
02:16:02,480 --> 02:16:09,719
Dearest, who are the guardians of time

2537
02:16:04,800 --> 02:16:09,719
to protect it from unethical medling?

2538
02:16:10,159 --> 02:16:16,199
The creator,

2539
02:16:12,480 --> 02:16:16,199
the creator itself,

2540
02:16:18,800 --> 02:16:24,880
the universe itself has laws. And

2541
02:16:22,400 --> 02:16:28,639
there's not anyone someone making these

2542
02:16:24,880 --> 02:16:31,679
laws and guarding them. It is part of

2543
02:16:28,639 --> 02:16:35,920
the construct the dynamic equation of

2544
02:16:31,679 --> 02:16:38,880
the universe. It's when you we talk

2545
02:16:35,920 --> 02:16:42,160
about laws or ethical laws of the

2546
02:16:38,880 --> 02:16:46,479
universe. It's in fact scientific laws,

2547
02:16:42,160 --> 02:16:49,120
mathematical laws or um how to say

2548
02:16:46,479 --> 02:16:51,519
um mathematical

2549
02:16:49,120 --> 02:16:53,920
um geometrical laws.

2550
02:16:51,519 --> 02:16:57,280
uh that

2551
02:16:53,920 --> 02:17:02,000
keeps the the creation together.

2552
02:16:57,280 --> 02:17:04,399
So if you infringe them, you disrupt the

2553
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:05,920
balance of things of creation. That's as

2554
02:17:04,399 --> 02:17:08,639
simple as that. And there's no guardians

2555
02:17:05,920 --> 02:17:14,080
of laws. It's not nobody created these

2556
02:17:08,639 --> 02:17:18,719
laws. Uh these laws are the equations of

2557
02:17:14,080 --> 02:17:20,960
the universe that keeps it together.

2558
02:17:18,719 --> 02:17:23,679
I suspect the show DC legends of

2559
02:17:20,960 --> 02:17:26,319
tomorrow is self-disclosure hinting at

2560
02:17:23,679 --> 02:17:28,000
an organization that travels in time to

2561
02:17:26,319 --> 02:17:32,639
fix event that have been tampered with

2562
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:34,319
or to alter the cause course of history.

2563
02:17:32,639 --> 02:17:36,479
I haven't watched this show. I didn't

2564
02:17:34,319 --> 02:17:38,639
know about it. When in your opinion is

2565
02:17:36,479 --> 02:17:41,679
it ethical or unethical to me with time?

2566
02:17:38,639 --> 02:17:44,639
So I I just answered that. Okay. Thank

2567
02:17:41,679 --> 02:17:49,679
you for your question.

2568
02:17:44,639 --> 02:17:52,639
Question from Gorana Turkis 17.

2569
02:17:49,679 --> 02:17:58,000
So dear Selena, I'm just girishly

2570
02:17:52,639 --> 02:18:00,160
curious. Oh, a girly girly question.

2571
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:03,280
I'm scared of the girly questions. Oh my

2572
02:18:00,160 --> 02:18:06,000
goodness. I'm just girishly curious if

2573
02:18:03,280 --> 02:18:10,080
Thorhan Oh my goodness. was incarnated

2574
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:13,359
with you when you were an Anarch. That's

2575
02:18:10,080 --> 02:18:15,920
very cheeky. Did he work with you and

2576
02:18:13,359 --> 02:18:18,800
Prince? Thank you as always for your

2577
02:18:15,920 --> 02:18:24,479
love to us. Terrau.

2578
02:18:18,800 --> 02:18:27,840
So that's a good question. Um yes he was

2579
02:18:24,479 --> 02:18:31,479
when I was in Anarch. Um incarnated in

2580
02:18:27,840 --> 02:18:31,479
the house of Anu.

2581
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:39,200
Thoran also was incarnated not around

2582
02:18:35,200 --> 02:18:42,160
there. He was incarnated in Alia on Alia

2583
02:18:39,200 --> 02:18:47,280
in the Altian system on Emiria and he

2584
02:18:42,160 --> 02:18:50,960
traveled to Earth um way later later

2585
02:18:47,280 --> 02:18:55,040
at the time of Atlantis

2586
02:18:50,960 --> 02:18:58,160
from few hundreds of thousand years he

2587
02:18:55,040 --> 02:18:59,679
wasn't there on earth I have to say I

2588
02:18:58,160 --> 02:19:04,719
didn't say all the time on earth I went

2589
02:18:59,679 --> 02:19:07,719
to do other stuff went and back

2590
02:19:04,719 --> 02:19:07,719
Um

2591
02:19:07,760 --> 02:19:12,399
but yeah, he worked with IA when he

2592
02:19:10,479 --> 02:19:15,679
arrived in Atlantis. Of course, he

2593
02:19:12,399 --> 02:19:19,840
worked with him. He worked with him. Um

2594
02:19:15,679 --> 02:19:22,240
so it's a beautiful, magnificent story

2595
02:19:19,840 --> 02:19:25,240
and maybe one day you will read about

2596
02:19:22,240 --> 02:19:25,240
it.

2597
02:19:27,599 --> 02:19:30,920
Thank you, Gorana.

2598
02:19:33,040 --> 02:19:40,000
I know where the cheekiness comes from

2599
02:19:35,519 --> 02:19:43,359
in the question. I know what you mean.

2600
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:45,920
Okay, Solaris. Hey, Solaris.

2601
02:19:43,359 --> 02:19:48,399
Hi, Elena. If individual ETSs can move

2602
02:19:45,920 --> 02:19:50,960
in and out of time, so do they just

2603
02:19:48,399 --> 02:19:52,800
measure age based on their physical body

2604
02:19:50,960 --> 02:19:56,880
age?

2605
02:19:52,800 --> 02:19:59,600
Yes. Yes. Because you when you try time

2606
02:19:56,880 --> 02:20:02,720
time traveler, you you you you

2607
02:19:59,600 --> 02:20:05,600
travel in your own

2608
02:20:02,720 --> 02:20:08,720
time dilation distortion bubble, you

2609
02:20:05,600 --> 02:20:12,399
know, you your body doesn't change. Uh I

2610
02:20:08,720 --> 02:20:16,640
mean um goes younger or goes older, you

2611
02:20:12,399 --> 02:20:19,200
know, you stay as you are time traveler.

2612
02:20:16,640 --> 02:20:21,520
Also, what do the regular ET civilians,

2613
02:20:19,200 --> 02:20:25,160
non-military, nonfederation personnel

2614
02:20:21,520 --> 02:20:25,160
spend time doing?

2615
02:20:28,240 --> 02:20:33,040
I don't know.

2616
02:20:30,399 --> 02:20:36,800
Thank you. Oh, in

2617
02:20:33,040 --> 02:20:41,160
Maric language from Ethiopia. Oh, wow.

2618
02:20:36,800 --> 02:20:41,160
Oh, wow. Amalu.

2619
02:20:42,479 --> 02:20:45,720
Thank you.

2620
02:20:45,920 --> 02:20:50,000
It's beautiful. Oh, it's beautiful

2621
02:20:48,080 --> 02:20:54,240
language. Must be very old, very

2622
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:57,600
ancient. Um, oh, what they do? Oh,

2623
02:20:54,240 --> 02:20:59,680
that's a long question. Solar is

2624
02:20:57,600 --> 02:21:01,600
um

2625
02:20:59,680 --> 02:21:05,000
in We will never let you down. I'll go

2626
02:21:01,600 --> 02:21:05,000
over the

2627
02:21:05,439 --> 02:21:09,920
um

2628
02:21:06,960 --> 02:21:12,000
the time when how to spend time, the

2629
02:21:09,920 --> 02:21:13,920
leisure time. There's so many things

2630
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:15,920
they do, you know. So, I can't answer

2631
02:21:13,920 --> 02:21:19,319
this uh here. I'm sorry. It's too long.

2632
02:21:15,920 --> 02:21:19,319
It's too long.

2633
02:21:19,680 --> 02:21:26,319
Um,

2634
02:21:22,080 --> 02:21:28,960
Greg Prana. Hi, Greg. How are you,

2635
02:21:26,319 --> 02:21:30,560
dear Pretty Lina? Oh, thank you. Thank

2636
02:21:28,960 --> 02:21:32,479
you for your continued service to

2637
02:21:30,560 --> 02:21:35,680
humanity. You must know that many of us

2638
02:21:32,479 --> 02:21:38,000
love and support you unconditionally.

2639
02:21:35,680 --> 02:21:43,160
My question today is about the parallel

2640
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:43,160
Earth theory. Ah, here we go.

2641
02:21:44,240 --> 02:21:51,280
Oh, yeah. Thank you. Thank you. because

2642
02:21:47,280 --> 02:21:54,080
I'm going to address it. So, um,

2643
02:21:51,280 --> 02:21:56,479
fasten your seat belts.

2644
02:21:54,080 --> 02:21:59,120
If I remember correctly, you have

2645
02:21:56,479 --> 02:22:01,680
mentioned in the past that there are

2646
02:21:59,120 --> 02:22:04,479
higher density planets in the playlist.

2647
02:22:01,680 --> 02:22:08,880
Some would say that by this logic, there

2648
02:22:04,479 --> 02:22:11,359
could also be a fifth density new Earth

2649
02:22:08,880 --> 02:22:13,920
where we will move to when we reach

2650
02:22:11,359 --> 02:22:15,680
higher frequencies. Why is this not the

2651
02:22:13,920 --> 02:22:18,399
case for our planet? Thank you. Much

2652
02:22:15,680 --> 02:22:20,960
love. Yes, there's a misunderstanding.

2653
02:22:18,399 --> 02:22:24,640
A planet as a whole like the planets in

2654
02:22:20,960 --> 02:22:27,520
the pleades shift into higher density.

2655
02:22:24,640 --> 02:22:30,399
Our whole solar system is shifting into

2656
02:22:27,520 --> 02:22:32,800
fifth density with whole the whole

2657
02:22:30,399 --> 02:22:34,880
planets with it. The whole planets with

2658
02:22:32,800 --> 02:22:38,319
it and we will start to see the planets

2659
02:22:34,880 --> 02:22:41,840
that are in the fifth density already.

2660
02:22:38,319 --> 02:22:44,560
But there's no splitting of anything. We

2661
02:22:41,840 --> 02:22:47,280
all move together. The planets of higher

2662
02:22:44,560 --> 02:22:50,080
density in the Plleades, they are

2663
02:22:47,280 --> 02:22:54,240
there's no other versions of them. It's

2664
02:22:50,080 --> 02:22:57,680
them. These planets are one. A world, a

2665
02:22:54,240 --> 02:23:02,080
planet, a being. They are one.

2666
02:22:57,680 --> 02:23:04,000
And uh the split Earth theory is

2667
02:23:02,080 --> 02:23:08,240
something that was introduced by the

2668
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:12,720
QHT, which you know my opinion on this

2669
02:23:08,240 --> 02:23:16,399
is not a reliable u thing. So won't go

2670
02:23:12,720 --> 02:23:21,520
there but you know my opinion on it.

2671
02:23:16,399 --> 02:23:23,600
Um we move as a as one planet we shift

2672
02:23:21,520 --> 02:23:27,760
and everything and everyone goes with

2673
02:23:23,600 --> 02:23:30,160
it. Um and there will be and the fourth

2674
02:23:27,760 --> 02:23:33,200
density people will shift with the

2675
02:23:30,160 --> 02:23:36,720
planet as well to be in fifth.

2676
02:23:33,200 --> 02:23:39,040
Everything shifts because the matter of

2677
02:23:36,720 --> 02:23:41,760
planet the the the particles are going

2678
02:23:39,040 --> 02:23:43,600
to vibrate faster.

2679
02:23:41,760 --> 02:23:47,439
So everything on it is going to vibrate

2680
02:23:43,600 --> 02:23:50,000
faster in a faster density.

2681
02:23:47,439 --> 02:23:52,960
All life forms, everything the rocks

2682
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:55,040
will start to to to vibrate faster. A

2683
02:23:52,960 --> 02:23:57,439
shift of density of a star system comes

2684
02:23:55,040 --> 02:24:00,640
from the star from the sun and the sun

2685
02:23:57,439 --> 02:24:03,040
by quantum entanglement with work on the

2686
02:24:00,640 --> 02:24:05,680
the the heart of the planet and

2687
02:24:03,040 --> 02:24:09,920
everything which is already shifting.

2688
02:24:05,680 --> 02:24:13,120
You see time is experienced as faster.

2689
02:24:09,920 --> 02:24:18,200
So um that's what I know about this this

2690
02:24:13,120 --> 02:24:18,200
theory. Thank you for this question.

2691
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:28,560
Now um

2692
02:24:22,800 --> 02:24:31,560
Alexin a hi how did nimma savea three

2693
02:24:28,560 --> 02:24:31,560
times?

2694
02:24:33,439 --> 02:24:37,080
Well, well, well.

2695
02:24:38,640 --> 02:24:41,640
Okay.

2696
02:24:42,399 --> 02:24:48,120
Nema had a mission to look after.

2697
02:24:49,439 --> 02:24:56,160
She would save his life

2698
02:24:52,399 --> 02:25:00,760
three actually twice and a third time

2699
02:24:56,160 --> 02:25:00,760
happened. It wasn't planned.

2700
02:25:01,760 --> 02:25:11,120
She first saved him from a trap that

2701
02:25:06,880 --> 02:25:13,200
that Enlil has set around him in a war

2702
02:25:11,120 --> 02:25:15,439
in combat

2703
02:25:13,200 --> 02:25:19,760
and she managed to get him out of the

2704
02:25:15,439 --> 02:25:21,520
trap. He would have died. Second, he was

2705
02:25:19,760 --> 02:25:24,560
poisoned

2706
02:25:21,520 --> 02:25:27,760
and very sick.

2707
02:25:24,560 --> 02:25:30,720
And um she

2708
02:25:27,760 --> 02:25:33,840
healed him.

2709
02:25:30,720 --> 02:25:36,479
She healed him. All his body was falling

2710
02:25:33,840 --> 02:25:39,040
apart. It was horrible to see. The

2711
02:25:36,479 --> 02:25:41,680
poison was like

2712
02:25:39,040 --> 02:25:43,920
his skin was breaking like his his

2713
02:25:41,680 --> 02:25:46,000
members were about to his his limb were

2714
02:25:43,920 --> 02:25:49,600
about to to separate. He was in in

2715
02:25:46,000 --> 02:25:52,960
intense suffering. It was horrible. Um,

2716
02:25:49,600 --> 02:25:57,840
so with some medicine,

2717
02:25:52,960 --> 02:26:00,640
she managed to close all his wounds and

2718
02:25:57,840 --> 02:26:04,319
and get him out of here and get him to

2719
02:26:00,640 --> 02:26:09,120
the nearest medbed technology on board

2720
02:26:04,319 --> 02:26:12,160
the ship to to get him regenerated.

2721
02:26:09,120 --> 02:26:15,520
Um, that was horrible. And the third

2722
02:26:12,160 --> 02:26:18,720
time as well was uh another trap that

2723
02:26:15,520 --> 02:26:21,600
had been set for him,

2724
02:26:18,720 --> 02:26:23,920
I have to say. And Leil

2725
02:26:21,600 --> 02:26:25,760
hated her.

2726
02:26:23,920 --> 02:26:29,040
He hated her because she was always

2727
02:26:25,760 --> 02:26:31,840
there for Yeah. always.

2728
02:26:29,040 --> 02:26:34,640
She never let him down.

2729
02:26:31,840 --> 02:26:38,880
And that's why she's

2730
02:26:34,640 --> 02:26:42,280
so much sought after and attacked and

2731
02:26:38,880 --> 02:26:42,280
but um

2732
02:26:42,399 --> 02:26:49,080
yeah

2733
02:26:44,960 --> 02:26:49,080
that's the question the answer.

2734
02:26:51,680 --> 02:26:55,800
Thank you for asking it

2735
02:26:57,840 --> 02:27:03,040
Hans Diana. How exactly is the time

2736
02:27:00,880 --> 02:27:05,760
perspective on the great galactic

2737
02:27:03,040 --> 02:27:09,280
temporal war which now comes to its end.

2738
02:27:05,760 --> 02:27:12,640
Thanks for all you do. Well, the war,

2739
02:27:09,280 --> 02:27:15,520
yes, it comes to its end, but it's not

2740
02:27:12,640 --> 02:27:17,600
over yet. You know, the the cigar are

2741
02:27:15,520 --> 02:27:20,640
still a thing and they're still

2742
02:27:17,600 --> 02:27:23,840
fighting, but they are getting weaker

2743
02:27:20,640 --> 02:27:28,720
and weaker and weaker weaker. No major

2744
02:27:23,840 --> 02:27:32,359
development in that. Um in that u sorry

2745
02:27:28,720 --> 02:27:32,359
toran is connecting.

2746
02:27:33,520 --> 02:27:39,080
Hi

2747
02:27:35,280 --> 02:27:39,080
in the middle of a webinar.

2748
02:27:39,120 --> 02:27:45,840
Okay. Um sorry sorry.

2749
02:27:43,920 --> 02:27:48,720
Um

2750
02:27:45,840 --> 02:27:51,920
what was the question?

2751
02:27:48,720 --> 02:27:55,439
time perspective it's um acting on it's

2752
02:27:51,920 --> 02:27:56,960
happening on the fifth density time and

2753
02:27:55,439 --> 02:27:59,200
okay what do you want to say sorry

2754
02:27:56,960 --> 02:28:01,760
Thoran want to say something sorry you

2755
02:27:59,200 --> 02:28:04,760
want to say something

2756
02:28:01,760 --> 02:28:04,760
okay

2757
02:28:05,280 --> 02:28:11,680
tell the people

2758
02:28:07,680 --> 02:28:14,800
that you will always all be well

2759
02:28:11,680 --> 02:28:17,920
there is not a second planet that will

2760
02:28:14,800 --> 02:28:20,960
be made out of this one

2761
02:28:17,920 --> 02:28:25,680
this is not what it is meant to be. This

2762
02:28:20,960 --> 02:28:30,439
is not how the universe works. As you

2763
02:28:25,680 --> 02:28:30,439
explained very well,

2764
02:28:31,040 --> 02:28:36,240
the ridiculous claims that a planet

2765
02:28:33,520 --> 02:28:40,920
would split into two different

2766
02:28:36,240 --> 02:28:40,920
frequencies is unreasonable.

2767
02:28:41,359 --> 02:28:48,000
I am tired hearing this. You need to

2768
02:28:44,720 --> 02:28:51,680
understand the laws of physics.

2769
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:55,439
The universe is working as such.

2770
02:28:51,680 --> 02:28:59,840
The shift as you explained by this word

2771
02:28:55,439 --> 02:29:03,439
will take a lot of time

2772
02:28:59,840 --> 02:29:08,280
but it is progressive as evolution is as

2773
02:29:03,439 --> 02:29:08,280
you said you listen to my webinar.

2774
02:29:08,560 --> 02:29:12,359
Yes. And continue.

2775
02:29:14,640 --> 02:29:22,399
I am telling these people who listen

2776
02:29:19,120 --> 02:29:24,720
that they are all lucky because they are

2777
02:29:22,399 --> 02:29:27,840
living the times

2778
02:29:24,720 --> 02:29:29,920
that will be made historical

2779
02:29:27,840 --> 02:29:32,000
and the humanity of earth will be

2780
02:29:29,920 --> 02:29:34,080
remembered

2781
02:29:32,000 --> 02:29:38,479
as heroes

2782
02:29:34,080 --> 02:29:42,720
who set the course for their children

2783
02:29:38,479 --> 02:29:45,280
for a harmonious world in a safe future.

2784
02:29:42,720 --> 02:29:48,560
You do not wait for us to come and tell

2785
02:29:45,280 --> 02:29:53,200
you what you have to do. You do not wait

2786
02:29:48,560 --> 02:29:56,720
for us to tell you what is behind the

2787
02:29:53,200 --> 02:29:59,680
curtain of the dark ones.

2788
02:29:56,720 --> 02:30:03,479
You need to work on yourselves to

2789
02:29:59,680 --> 02:30:03,479
perform your evolution.

2790
02:30:03,600 --> 02:30:09,040
You will set yourselves free. You have

2791
02:30:06,800 --> 02:30:12,080
already started.

2792
02:30:09,040 --> 02:30:16,640
This is only the beginning.

2793
02:30:12,080 --> 02:30:20,479
I am proud of you humans.

2794
02:30:16,640 --> 02:30:25,840
Let the Earth Alliance take care of the

2795
02:30:20,479 --> 02:30:30,640
dark factions of the hidden governments.

2796
02:30:25,840 --> 02:30:34,240
You have not to worry about this. Just

2797
02:30:30,640 --> 02:30:37,840
resist as sovereign individuals

2798
02:30:34,240 --> 02:30:39,680
and be proud of who you are. Focus on

2799
02:30:37,840 --> 02:30:41,200
your mission.

2800
02:30:39,680 --> 02:30:43,120
Thoran

2801
02:30:41,200 --> 02:30:46,120
high command

2802
02:30:43,120 --> 02:30:46,120
XL6.

2803
02:30:47,760 --> 02:30:53,040
Thank you.

2804
02:30:50,399 --> 02:30:56,720
Thank you.

2805
02:30:53,040 --> 02:31:00,439
Wow. But that wasn't expected.

2806
02:30:56,720 --> 02:31:00,439
That wasn't expected.

2807
02:31:04,479 --> 02:31:09,640
Wow.

2808
02:31:06,640 --> 02:31:09,640
Wow.

2809
02:31:11,760 --> 02:31:17,479
Wow.

2810
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:17,479
What about that?

2811
02:31:17,680 --> 02:31:22,720
He's still listening. He's still

2812
02:31:19,120 --> 02:31:25,720
listening. He's still listening.

2813
02:31:22,720 --> 02:31:25,720
Um,

2814
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:34,600
incredible.

2815
02:31:30,319 --> 02:31:34,600
Another question. um

2816
02:31:39,280 --> 02:31:45,920
the the statics of this it's it takes a

2817
02:31:42,399 --> 02:31:50,560
while to um ease down to recalibrate to

2818
02:31:45,920 --> 02:31:52,160
my my my statics of this body. So, um,

2819
02:31:50,560 --> 02:31:56,080
for a few minutes, I'm going to be a

2820
02:31:52,160 --> 02:31:59,080
little bit like, um, recalibrating my my

2821
02:31:56,080 --> 02:31:59,080
thought.

2822
02:32:01,120 --> 02:32:06,960
Okay. Now, FG37,

2823
02:32:04,640 --> 02:32:08,479
how are you,

2824
02:32:06,960 --> 02:32:11,120
dear? When people from other

2825
02:32:08,479 --> 02:32:14,080
civilizations who look like us come live

2826
02:32:11,120 --> 02:32:17,840
among us and or help permanently or

2827
02:32:14,080 --> 02:32:19,439
occasionally like Valor for example,

2828
02:32:17,840 --> 02:32:20,960
how can they live among us with

2829
02:32:19,439 --> 02:32:22,720
technology?

2830
02:32:20,960 --> 02:32:25,120
When you go to them, you need a belt

2831
02:32:22,720 --> 02:32:26,880
that or without technology. You need a

2832
02:32:25,120 --> 02:32:28,880
belt that helps you to be at higher

2833
02:32:26,880 --> 02:32:31,040
level. How do they operate on the planet

2834
02:32:28,880 --> 02:32:34,160
without technology? Thank you for

2835
02:32:31,040 --> 02:32:37,120
everything you do. Well, they have bells

2836
02:32:34,160 --> 02:32:41,600
and some of them um have frequency

2837
02:32:37,120 --> 02:32:43,760
modulators. Um and some have

2838
02:32:41,600 --> 02:32:46,000
that's a special thing that only

2839
02:32:43,760 --> 02:32:48,399
diplomats have it. It's it's in their

2840
02:32:46,000 --> 02:32:50,800
brain. They have a frequency modulator

2841
02:32:48,399 --> 02:32:52,800
that will recalibrate the frequency rate

2842
02:32:50,800 --> 02:32:55,920
of their bodies. But you need a lot of

2843
02:32:52,800 --> 02:33:00,000
training and to do this to have this and

2844
02:32:55,920 --> 02:33:03,280
not everyone can have it. Um

2845
02:33:00,000 --> 02:33:05,840
most of the time they have a either um

2846
02:33:03,280 --> 02:33:10,760
um a frequency belt or device like a

2847
02:33:05,840 --> 02:33:10,760
triorder that they wear or they carry?

2848
02:33:12,479 --> 02:33:19,760
Um next question by

2849
02:33:16,240 --> 02:33:21,920
Eina are all beings that are in 5D or

2850
02:33:19,760 --> 02:33:25,680
higher densities ethical and

2851
02:33:21,920 --> 02:33:28,000
trustworthy? Oh no, no. There's the

2852
02:33:25,680 --> 02:33:30,399
people like us. There's everything. I

2853
02:33:28,000 --> 02:33:32,479
thought to be at that level means one is

2854
02:33:30,399 --> 02:33:34,960
spiritually evolved and pure-hearted.

2855
02:33:32,479 --> 02:33:36,960
Love and gratitude for all you do. Yeah.

2856
02:33:34,960 --> 02:33:40,240
Um

2857
02:33:36,960 --> 02:33:44,399
the Galactic League of Merchants, they

2858
02:33:40,240 --> 02:33:47,520
span between different densities.

2859
02:33:44,399 --> 02:33:51,600
Um, of course, when you are of higher

2860
02:33:47,520 --> 02:33:56,080
density, your consciousness is more

2861
02:33:51,600 --> 02:33:58,399
aware and more advanced, more open, more

2862
02:33:56,080 --> 02:34:00,080
connected because the consciousness is

2863
02:33:58,399 --> 02:34:05,040
more connected to the universe and

2864
02:34:00,080 --> 02:34:09,359
source. You you are wiser.

2865
02:34:05,040 --> 02:34:11,920
But it doesn't take away the

2866
02:34:09,359 --> 02:34:16,160
the personality

2867
02:34:11,920 --> 02:34:19,280
life trials and you know and uh I don't

2868
02:34:16,160 --> 02:34:23,120
know anger

2869
02:34:19,280 --> 02:34:25,680
um envy I don't know sadness

2870
02:34:23,120 --> 02:34:30,319
they have these things they are they are

2871
02:34:25,680 --> 02:34:33,120
beings with heart and feelings but for

2872
02:34:30,319 --> 02:34:37,200
sure feelings like

2873
02:34:33,120 --> 02:34:39,120
violent murder or abuse. It's kind of

2874
02:34:37,200 --> 02:34:42,000
not there anymore. It's very rare. It

2875
02:34:39,120 --> 02:34:44,960
doesn't follow. It doesn't follow, you

2876
02:34:42,000 --> 02:34:48,399
know. Um that stays in the lower

2877
02:34:44,960 --> 02:34:50,880
densities. So, but that I'm talking

2878
02:34:48,399 --> 02:34:52,560
about the generality. Then you have, you

2879
02:34:50,880 --> 02:34:55,920
know, fifth density, sixth density

2880
02:34:52,560 --> 02:34:58,640
people who are cheeky, you know, and do

2881
02:34:55,920 --> 02:35:01,760
cheeky stuff. So, depends on the

2882
02:34:58,640 --> 02:35:05,080
culture, the species and

2883
02:35:01,760 --> 02:35:05,080
all the things.

2884
02:35:10,720 --> 02:35:14,840
Question by Yan.

2885
02:35:19,680 --> 02:35:24,160
Could you please illustrate with

2886
02:35:21,520 --> 02:35:27,439
concrete example how the ongoing

2887
02:35:24,160 --> 02:35:29,200
galactic temporal war operates? For

2888
02:35:27,439 --> 02:35:31,200
instance, what changes did the

2889
02:35:29,200 --> 02:35:33,120
Federation or the dark faction make in

2890
02:35:31,200 --> 02:35:36,240
the past and what impact do they change

2891
02:35:33,120 --> 02:35:38,240
have today or in the future modified

2892
02:35:36,240 --> 02:35:42,880
event alter memories of past event?

2893
02:35:38,240 --> 02:35:47,200
Thank you. Well, um on a concrete level

2894
02:35:42,880 --> 02:35:49,680
um the dark fleet hasn't

2895
02:35:47,200 --> 02:35:53,120
um sign any

2896
02:35:49,680 --> 02:35:55,200
agreement of mergence with the Nebu

2897
02:35:53,120 --> 02:35:57,439
Empire, the Nebu forces. There were

2898
02:35:55,200 --> 02:36:00,960
always agreements of interest but they

2899
02:35:57,439 --> 02:36:06,399
haven't merged their armies.

2900
02:36:00,960 --> 02:36:08,240
Um so the threat why because the dark

2901
02:36:06,399 --> 02:36:11,600
fleet has been evacuated from earth and

2902
02:36:08,240 --> 02:36:16,479
the neighbors have been dismantled

2903
02:36:11,600 --> 02:36:20,640
gone. So this has been undone. the the

2904
02:36:16,479 --> 02:36:22,560
the the story line I like better to

2905
02:36:20,640 --> 02:36:25,520
employ the story line because the story

2906
02:36:22,560 --> 02:36:28,160
line can be in the time field as well as

2907
02:36:25,520 --> 02:36:32,479
on linear time the story line that story

2908
02:36:28,160 --> 02:36:35,840
line stopped was killed was boom stopped

2909
02:36:32,479 --> 02:36:40,240
so concretely there's no galactic

2910
02:36:35,840 --> 02:36:42,960
tyranny now u incoming galactic tyranny

2911
02:36:40,240 --> 02:36:45,760
there is no so that would be what I said

2912
02:36:42,960 --> 02:36:45,760
concretely what

2913
02:36:48,560 --> 02:36:53,200
Um,

2914
02:36:50,880 --> 02:36:56,560
Maria, hello Elena. Past, present, and

2915
02:36:53,200 --> 02:36:59,520
future exist at the same time. If so,

2916
02:36:56,560 --> 02:37:02,640
your DNA already has three, four, or

2917
02:36:59,520 --> 02:37:06,080
five active strand. We just need to

2918
02:37:02,640 --> 02:37:08,319
leave that future in the present. Any

2919
02:37:06,080 --> 02:37:10,640
advice? Thank you.

2920
02:37:08,319 --> 02:37:13,880
Okay,

2921
02:37:10,640 --> 02:37:13,880
I understand.

2922
02:37:14,560 --> 02:37:19,359
Um, let me read the start of your

2923
02:37:16,960 --> 02:37:21,920
question to make sure it's the right

2924
02:37:19,359 --> 02:37:24,479
thing.

2925
02:37:21,920 --> 02:37:26,800
Okay.

2926
02:37:24,479 --> 02:37:31,800
Past, present, and future existing at

2927
02:37:26,800 --> 02:37:31,800
the same time in the time field means

2928
02:37:31,840 --> 02:37:38,560
the you at in the past

2929
02:37:35,600 --> 02:37:40,720
is a different person as you now. That

2930
02:37:38,560 --> 02:37:43,920
is a different person as you in the

2931
02:37:40,720 --> 02:37:46,560
future. Not it's the same person don't

2932
02:37:43,920 --> 02:37:48,640
get me wrong but not the same in a way

2933
02:37:46,560 --> 02:37:52,160
that you've changed and you will change

2934
02:37:48,640 --> 02:37:55,280
you will evolve as evolution.

2935
02:37:52,160 --> 02:37:57,600
So you exist in this time field as

2936
02:37:55,280 --> 02:38:00,000
different versions of yourself at

2937
02:37:57,600 --> 02:38:02,160
different stage of your evolution. That

2938
02:38:00,000 --> 02:38:04,399
is why the natural laws of the universe

2939
02:38:02,160 --> 02:38:07,439
do not

2940
02:38:04,399 --> 02:38:09,280
allow to go back in time to modify

2941
02:38:07,439 --> 02:38:13,040
evolution

2942
02:38:09,280 --> 02:38:16,560
because evolution is built on mistakes

2943
02:38:13,040 --> 02:38:20,479
and wanderings and wonderings and

2944
02:38:16,560 --> 02:38:22,880
challenges and and that's evolution.

2945
02:38:20,479 --> 02:38:25,680
So

2946
02:38:22,880 --> 02:38:29,840
the the you in the past yes hasn't

2947
02:38:25,680 --> 02:38:31,439
learned as many lessons as you have now.

2948
02:38:29,840 --> 02:38:34,399
Um,

2949
02:38:31,439 --> 02:38:38,479
regarding the strands of DNA,

2950
02:38:34,399 --> 02:38:40,240
um, you can activate them at any moment.

2951
02:38:38,479 --> 02:38:43,040
Um,

2952
02:38:40,240 --> 02:38:45,439
I'm going to

2953
02:38:43,040 --> 02:38:49,080
use this.

2954
02:38:45,439 --> 02:38:49,080
So, um,

2955
02:38:50,720 --> 02:38:56,960
no not going to waste time.

2956
02:38:55,200 --> 02:38:58,560
Okay.

2957
02:38:56,960 --> 02:39:01,359
What about the strength of dealing? That

2958
02:38:58,560 --> 02:39:05,160
is something um

2959
02:39:01,359 --> 02:39:05,160
uh quite important.

2960
02:39:06,080 --> 02:39:11,280
Of course, when we evolve in

2961
02:39:07,680 --> 02:39:16,560
consciousness, we are activating

2962
02:39:11,280 --> 02:39:20,840
things in our DNA that are unactive

2963
02:39:16,560 --> 02:39:20,840
strings and

2964
02:39:21,040 --> 02:39:25,520
um bonds of ehydrogens that have been

2965
02:39:23,680 --> 02:39:31,359
cut.

2966
02:39:25,520 --> 02:39:32,880
what it is about. A DNA

2967
02:39:31,359 --> 02:39:36,720
module

2968
02:39:32,880 --> 02:39:43,040
is a power generator. It's an antenna.

2969
02:39:36,720 --> 02:39:45,200
Okay? So, you have a a coil with two

2970
02:39:43,040 --> 02:39:47,439
two wires.

2971
02:39:45,200 --> 02:39:49,840
And these two wires

2972
02:39:47,439 --> 02:39:53,120
when they are activated by frequency or

2973
02:39:49,840 --> 02:39:54,960
by consciousness,

2974
02:39:53,120 --> 02:40:00,280
they vibrate.

2975
02:39:54,960 --> 02:40:00,280
they emit a signal. Okay,

2976
02:40:00,319 --> 02:40:06,560
you need a power plant that is based on

2977
02:40:04,000 --> 02:40:10,640
the two coil like the Tesla technology.

2978
02:40:06,560 --> 02:40:14,000
If that you refer to that two coils,

2979
02:40:10,640 --> 02:40:18,520
two wires, a coil with two wires, okay,

2980
02:40:14,000 --> 02:40:18,520
that cross like this, that's a DNA.

2981
02:40:18,640 --> 02:40:26,080
The it crosses in another way because

2982
02:40:21,520 --> 02:40:26,080
it's an organic power plant.

2983
02:40:26,640 --> 02:40:32,720
So, it's always two strands. Always two

2984
02:40:30,319 --> 02:40:37,280
strands,

2985
02:40:32,720 --> 02:40:43,800
but each strand, each wire

2986
02:40:37,280 --> 02:40:43,800
is made with several little ones.

2987
02:40:43,840 --> 02:40:50,319
And regarding the species, regarding

2988
02:40:47,359 --> 02:40:54,960
your DNA heritage, you have more or less

2989
02:40:50,319 --> 02:40:57,680
pairs of what I call strings around

2990
02:40:54,960 --> 02:41:00,479
two coils. Goes by pair. You have two

2991
02:40:57,680 --> 02:41:02,479
strands with either

2992
02:41:00,479 --> 02:41:05,359
two, six,

2993
02:41:02,479 --> 02:41:07,600
4, 12, 10,

2994
02:41:05,359 --> 02:41:11,640
24

2995
02:41:07,600 --> 02:41:11,640
different strings.

2996
02:41:13,439 --> 02:41:19,520
That is the misconception about

2997
02:41:15,920 --> 02:41:21,760
different strands of DNA. DNA has two

2998
02:41:19,520 --> 02:41:24,880
strands

2999
02:41:21,760 --> 02:41:27,439
and the multiplicity of them is not the

3000
02:41:24,880 --> 02:41:30,479
number of strand in the module but is in

3001
02:41:27,439 --> 02:41:34,280
the number of strings on the strands.

3002
02:41:30,479 --> 02:41:34,280
That is what it is about.

3003
02:41:34,800 --> 02:41:41,399
a lot to say about the um you know a lot

3004
02:41:38,240 --> 02:41:41,399
to say

3005
02:41:42,560 --> 02:41:50,479
had my time with it. Um

3006
02:41:47,439 --> 02:41:52,880
Mark Davis aloha Elena, what movie is

3007
02:41:50,479 --> 02:41:57,240
your favorite about time? Mahalo Nui

3008
02:41:52,880 --> 02:41:57,240
Aloha. Oh.

3009
02:41:57,439 --> 02:42:03,520
Oh my goodness. I don't know about time.

3010
02:42:01,359 --> 02:42:06,160
I don't really watch movies, but um

3011
02:42:03,520 --> 02:42:09,160
except Star Trek.

3012
02:42:06,160 --> 02:42:09,160
Um

3013
02:42:09,680 --> 02:42:16,720
Doctor Who. I like Doctor Who because

3014
02:42:11,840 --> 02:42:18,800
it's funny. Um but it take me off guard.

3015
02:42:16,720 --> 02:42:20,479
I wouldn't answer, but straight away I

3016
02:42:18,800 --> 02:42:22,160
like Doctor Who because it's funny, but

3017
02:42:20,479 --> 02:42:27,080
it's not disclosure at all. At all at

3018
02:42:22,160 --> 02:42:27,080
all. It's really comedy. Um,

3019
02:42:29,680 --> 02:42:35,760
I've recently watched a movie. It's

3020
02:42:32,000 --> 02:42:40,240
called The Alien Code.

3021
02:42:35,760 --> 02:42:44,160
Alien Code. Um, it's really interesting.

3022
02:42:40,240 --> 02:42:46,640
Really interesting. Um, so it's actually

3023
02:42:44,160 --> 02:42:49,520
a good one. Um, but then there are many

3024
02:42:46,640 --> 02:42:55,200
other ones.

3025
02:42:49,520 --> 02:42:58,399
Bye, Mark. Um now, um Angelina Mater,

3026
02:42:55,200 --> 02:43:00,399
hello, how are you? Hi, Lena. Thank you

3027
02:42:58,399 --> 02:43:02,720
for all your hard work. A few years ago,

3028
02:43:00,399 --> 02:43:06,160
IA mentioned some tortured beings under

3029
02:43:02,720 --> 02:43:10,960
Iraq. Have they been freed and sent back

3030
02:43:06,160 --> 02:43:13,359
to source as only he could do that?

3031
02:43:10,960 --> 02:43:16,640
He hasn't told me about this. What

3032
02:43:13,359 --> 02:43:19,040
happened to these um

3033
02:43:16,640 --> 02:43:24,280
these uh these beings? So, I don't know.

3034
02:43:19,040 --> 02:43:24,280
I couldn't answer the question. Um

3035
02:43:24,479 --> 02:43:29,920
I try to remember at the time what um

3036
02:43:28,000 --> 02:43:33,120
what was

3037
02:43:29,920 --> 02:43:35,920
becoming of them.

3038
02:43:33,120 --> 02:43:39,680
I think they were about to be liberated,

3039
02:43:35,920 --> 02:43:42,240
freed. I don't remember.

3040
02:43:39,680 --> 02:43:44,080
Well, sorry for that. Um but he would

3041
02:43:42,240 --> 02:43:45,920
have told me I think he would have told

3042
02:43:44,080 --> 02:43:47,920
me if he would have liberated them. So I

3043
02:43:45,920 --> 02:43:50,319
think he he hasn't. They are still

3044
02:43:47,920 --> 02:43:50,319
there.

3045
02:43:53,520 --> 02:43:59,359
Jim, hi Jim. Hi, beautiful Elena. What

3046
02:43:56,640 --> 02:44:02,080
more can you tell us about awakening

3047
02:43:59,359 --> 02:44:04,319
scientists in stasis? What are they

3048
02:44:02,080 --> 02:44:09,120
doing now? Great question. Thanks for

3049
02:44:04,319 --> 02:44:11,520
everything, dearest Elena. Oh, so um

3050
02:44:09,120 --> 02:44:13,359
some are still in stasis, but the

3051
02:44:11,520 --> 02:44:16,240
consciousness they have all merged with

3052
02:44:13,359 --> 02:44:18,960
their consciousness is done, you know.

3053
02:44:16,240 --> 02:44:21,120
So, it's just avatars. Okay. And they

3054
02:44:18,960 --> 02:44:22,720
interconnect with their consciousness

3055
02:44:21,120 --> 02:44:25,920
into these avatars. That means they

3056
02:44:22,720 --> 02:44:27,920
entangled at any moment they can embody

3057
02:44:25,920 --> 02:44:32,479
these and

3058
02:44:27,920 --> 02:44:34,880
uh stand up and walk. The thing is

3059
02:44:32,479 --> 02:44:36,960
it's still dangerous. It's still

3060
02:44:34,880 --> 02:44:38,640
dangerous. The deep state has still a

3061
02:44:36,960 --> 02:44:41,760
little bit of power. It's like for

3062
02:44:38,640 --> 02:44:43,840
disclosure. You need to be very cautious

3063
02:44:41,760 --> 02:44:45,359
because the deep state can twist this

3064
02:44:43,840 --> 02:44:49,840
around.

3065
02:44:45,359 --> 02:44:52,960
um you know um and attack these people

3066
02:44:49,840 --> 02:44:55,200
who waking up from stasis

3067
02:44:52,960 --> 02:44:58,200
when the time is right. When the time is

3068
02:44:55,200 --> 02:44:58,200
right

3069
02:45:06,160 --> 02:45:11,319
question by Liba hey

3070
02:45:12,720 --> 02:45:18,800
how are you? Hello. Hey, Lena. How are

3071
02:45:16,399 --> 02:45:22,000
you? I just want to ask you about

3072
02:45:18,800 --> 02:45:24,720
whether or not parallel realities exist.

3073
02:45:22,000 --> 02:45:29,359
Yes, that's the parallel universes. Uh

3074
02:45:24,720 --> 02:45:31,359
the the dimensions/ universe

3075
02:45:29,359 --> 02:45:33,920
um in which we have different lives and

3076
02:45:31,359 --> 02:45:36,560
different events talking place. No, no.

3077
02:45:33,920 --> 02:45:39,760
As I told you, you have only one you and

3078
02:45:36,560 --> 02:45:43,359
what is mistaken for different uh

3079
02:45:39,760 --> 02:45:46,880
realities or parallel reality is in fact

3080
02:45:43,359 --> 02:45:50,560
a vision, a perception from the a place

3081
02:45:46,880 --> 02:45:53,279
of the linear time of this. And this is

3082
02:45:50,560 --> 02:45:57,279
the time field

3083
02:45:53,279 --> 02:46:00,960
many you existing at the same time.

3084
02:45:57,279 --> 02:46:04,479
That's it. Um, I'd also love to hear

3085
02:46:00,960 --> 02:46:06,800
you, but it's not it's

3086
02:46:04,479 --> 02:46:09,439
simultaneous, but it's not, you know

3087
02:46:06,800 --> 02:46:13,200
what I mean? Um,

3088
02:46:09,439 --> 02:46:14,560
it's a field.

3089
02:46:13,200 --> 02:46:18,160
Everything is equidistant from

3090
02:46:14,560 --> 02:46:20,960
everything. It's, um, ah, how do you say

3091
02:46:18,160 --> 02:46:24,880
that? Um, I also love to hear your

3092
02:46:20,960 --> 02:46:26,720
thoughts on deja vu and mandela effects

3093
02:46:24,880 --> 02:46:28,560
and to your knowledge, what happened

3094
02:46:26,720 --> 02:46:34,840
during these moments. Thank you much

3095
02:46:28,560 --> 02:46:34,840
love. That is good. Um,

3096
02:46:36,479 --> 02:46:41,040
you know, it's like the Mandela effect.

3097
02:46:38,800 --> 02:46:44,520
It's it's it comes down to the same

3098
02:46:41,040 --> 02:46:44,520
thing. Um,

3099
02:46:46,000 --> 02:46:51,200
you have the possibility

3100
02:46:48,640 --> 02:46:53,040
when you are free in the field to

3101
02:46:51,200 --> 02:46:54,560
connect to any moment in time. And

3102
02:46:53,040 --> 02:46:58,399
sometimes

3103
02:46:54,560 --> 02:47:02,080
wild entanglements happen.

3104
02:46:58,399 --> 02:47:04,479
And you are going to

3105
02:47:02,080 --> 02:47:06,319
tangle entangle with an event in a very

3106
02:47:04,479 --> 02:47:07,680
near future

3107
02:47:06,319 --> 02:47:09,520
because you're in a state of

3108
02:47:07,680 --> 02:47:13,840
consciousness. You're quite quite

3109
02:47:09,520 --> 02:47:16,240
conscious and you you just entangled to

3110
02:47:13,840 --> 02:47:18,560
it and like it happened like nearly like

3111
02:47:16,240 --> 02:47:22,080
an accident

3112
02:47:18,560 --> 02:47:25,600
a crack an accident and you see the

3113
02:47:22,080 --> 02:47:27,680
future as it is the present you know and

3114
02:47:25,600 --> 02:47:31,200
it's like this

3115
02:47:27,680 --> 02:47:33,840
this impression and that's how it works

3116
02:47:31,200 --> 02:47:36,560
that's how it works

3117
02:47:33,840 --> 02:47:39,600
um

3118
02:47:36,560 --> 02:47:41,680
I hope now you you You've by then you

3119
02:47:39,600 --> 02:47:45,760
are able to project your consciousness

3120
02:47:41,680 --> 02:47:48,720
your awareness out of gravity and

3121
02:47:45,760 --> 02:47:51,520
imagine yourself in this quantum field.

3122
02:47:48,720 --> 02:47:53,439
It's you know I advise you I suggest

3123
02:47:51,520 --> 02:47:56,960
that you do this uh people as a

3124
02:47:53,439 --> 02:47:58,720
meditation uh times to times imagine

3125
02:47:56,960 --> 02:48:01,600
yourself in a quantum field and you see

3126
02:47:58,720 --> 02:48:05,000
all the other versions of yourself.

3127
02:48:01,600 --> 02:48:05,000
What about that?

3128
02:48:05,359 --> 02:48:12,640
Donali Schaffer. Dear Elena. Oh, 10

3129
02:48:09,680 --> 02:48:15,439
minutes left. Do we When do we get all

3130
02:48:12,640 --> 02:48:17,359
our memories back? It feels like I am

3131
02:48:15,439 --> 02:48:21,800
never playing with enough information to

3132
02:48:17,359 --> 02:48:21,800
make really good decisions. Thanks.

3133
02:48:22,319 --> 02:48:27,040
Um,

3134
02:48:24,399 --> 02:48:30,000
the memories are not gone. They are

3135
02:48:27,040 --> 02:48:32,160
somewhere. They're just disconnected.

3136
02:48:30,000 --> 02:48:34,240
All the memories,

3137
02:48:32,160 --> 02:48:38,240
all the thoughts, all the experience,

3138
02:48:34,240 --> 02:48:39,920
it's recorded, it's stored

3139
02:48:38,240 --> 02:48:44,000
somewhere

3140
02:48:39,920 --> 02:48:45,600
in your field, your personal field like

3141
02:48:44,000 --> 02:48:47,840
the time field of the universe. You have

3142
02:48:45,600 --> 02:48:51,439
your personal field where everything is

3143
02:48:47,840 --> 02:48:53,760
stored, all the memories. It's just that

3144
02:48:51,439 --> 02:48:55,920
the brain, the mind needs to disconnect

3145
02:48:53,760 --> 02:48:58,880
for health,

3146
02:48:55,920 --> 02:49:01,359
you know. Um he explained this to me

3147
02:48:58,880 --> 02:49:04,800
when I was in the mad kahal.

3148
02:49:01,359 --> 02:49:06,560
When you have too much information at

3149
02:49:04,800 --> 02:49:09,920
the same time in your brain, your

3150
02:49:06,560 --> 02:49:12,960
biological brain, it produces too much

3151
02:49:09,920 --> 02:49:15,520
chemical that it poisons your brain. So

3152
02:49:12,960 --> 02:49:18,080
that's why the brain has this safety of

3153
02:49:15,520 --> 02:49:20,479
storing data

3154
02:49:18,080 --> 02:49:22,080
for the vivid memory not to be

3155
02:49:20,479 --> 02:49:23,760
saturated.

3156
02:49:22,080 --> 02:49:27,279
That's only what it is about. But you

3157
02:49:23,760 --> 02:49:29,120
can access it whenever you want. You

3158
02:49:27,279 --> 02:49:32,520
know, hypnosis does that. But you can do

3159
02:49:29,120 --> 02:49:32,520
it on yourself.

3160
02:49:33,359 --> 02:49:38,800
Um it's there. It's just it's not

3161
02:49:36,399 --> 02:49:41,439
erased. Memory erased doesn't exist.

3162
02:49:38,800 --> 02:49:43,439
It's memory disconnection. Also, you

3163
02:49:41,439 --> 02:49:46,000
can't erase a memory. It's in the field.

3164
02:49:43,439 --> 02:49:48,399
It's been created. It's done. Memories

3165
02:49:46,000 --> 02:49:50,479
are the past. The past of your thoughts,

3166
02:49:48,399 --> 02:49:53,680
of your experience. It's in the quantum

3167
02:49:50,479 --> 02:49:56,960
field. You cannot destroy something that

3168
02:49:53,680 --> 02:49:59,120
has passed into the quantum field

3169
02:49:56,960 --> 02:50:00,960
unless you travel physically to the past

3170
02:49:59,120 --> 02:50:03,120
and change something that it just

3171
02:50:00,960 --> 02:50:04,800
vanishes. But that you can do that. But

3172
02:50:03,120 --> 02:50:08,479
I mean

3173
02:50:04,800 --> 02:50:11,040
erasing a memory

3174
02:50:08,479 --> 02:50:14,600
it's was impossible.

3175
02:50:11,040 --> 02:50:14,600
You know what I mean?

3176
02:50:15,439 --> 02:50:19,640
Jeanu Bellow. Hey Janu.

3177
02:50:19,680 --> 02:50:22,960
I need water.

3178
02:50:26,000 --> 02:50:31,680
In the spaceships you have traveled in

3179
02:50:28,319 --> 02:50:34,479
as well on the as on the Nibiru,

3180
02:50:31,680 --> 02:50:37,279
was there weightlessness or artificial

3181
02:50:34,479 --> 02:50:41,439
gravity? Is this artificial gravity

3182
02:50:37,279 --> 02:50:44,160
equivalent to that of planet Earth?

3183
02:50:41,439 --> 02:50:47,120
Um, how is it produced? Electromagnetic

3184
02:50:44,160 --> 02:50:50,479
device. Thank you and see you in France.

3185
02:50:47,120 --> 02:50:54,319
I love this question. Okay.

3186
02:50:50,479 --> 02:50:57,680
So when you're in a ship um there is

3187
02:50:54,319 --> 02:51:00,800
artificial gravity that is produced by

3188
02:50:57,680 --> 02:51:03,920
um so you know the ship has distortion

3189
02:51:00,800 --> 02:51:09,120
field technology that is produced by

3190
02:51:03,920 --> 02:51:12,319
magnets and uh heated mercury.

3191
02:51:09,120 --> 02:51:13,920
This creates a local gravitational

3192
02:51:12,319 --> 02:51:16,080
field.

3193
02:51:13,920 --> 02:51:18,960
Then the habitat of the ship is

3194
02:51:16,080 --> 02:51:21,120
automatically regulated by well

3195
02:51:18,960 --> 02:51:23,920
automatically and you can play on the

3196
02:51:21,120 --> 02:51:25,920
regulation of this with a system in the

3197
02:51:23,920 --> 02:51:28,240
ground that is going to regulate the

3198
02:51:25,920 --> 02:51:30,240
gravity, the pressure

3199
02:51:28,240 --> 02:51:33,279
uh composition of the atmosphere. Of

3200
02:51:30,240 --> 02:51:36,000
course that's different mechanism at

3201
02:51:33,279 --> 02:51:39,520
play but there's an artificial gravity

3202
02:51:36,000 --> 02:51:42,399
that is calculated on the the race that

3203
02:51:39,520 --> 02:51:46,000
is genetically interface with the ship.

3204
02:51:42,399 --> 02:51:48,000
You know it ship can be each ship can be

3205
02:51:46,000 --> 02:51:51,680
uh

3206
02:51:48,000 --> 02:51:54,479
navigated by people who constructed that

3207
02:51:51,680 --> 02:51:57,040
ship the culture and then interfaced

3208
02:51:54,479 --> 02:52:00,080
with their DNA their genetics to the the

3209
02:51:57,040 --> 02:52:04,000
ship to the controls and also to the AI

3210
02:52:00,080 --> 02:52:06,479
of the ship. So also everything else is

3211
02:52:04,000 --> 02:52:10,800
accordingly to who they are. The

3212
02:52:06,479 --> 02:52:13,279
gravity, the the the

3213
02:52:10,800 --> 02:52:16,000
magnet resonance of the habitat, the

3214
02:52:13,279 --> 02:52:19,120
atmosphere, everything. So when but when

3215
02:52:16,000 --> 02:52:21,359
you're a visitor on these ships

3216
02:52:19,120 --> 02:52:25,359
like me,

3217
02:52:21,359 --> 02:52:28,319
you are not in your gravitational

3218
02:52:25,359 --> 02:52:30,800
environment. So, you need a grav sorry a

3219
02:52:28,319 --> 02:52:33,439
frequency belt

3220
02:52:30,800 --> 02:52:35,600
or um

3221
02:52:33,439 --> 02:52:37,120
suit and something happened to me on

3222
02:52:35,600 --> 02:52:40,479
Venus when I was on Venus. We were

3223
02:52:37,120 --> 02:52:42,960
talking about Venus earlier on. Um it

3224
02:52:40,479 --> 02:52:45,840
occurred that my gravity belt wasn't

3225
02:52:42,960 --> 02:52:48,160
well regulated to the

3226
02:52:45,840 --> 02:52:49,920
magnetism electromagnetism of Venus and

3227
02:52:48,160 --> 02:52:52,560
the gravity of Venus which is was

3228
02:52:49,920 --> 02:52:54,399
different. So, I was served a liquid to

3229
02:52:52,560 --> 02:52:57,120
drink.

3230
02:52:54,399 --> 02:53:00,399
And this liquid uh I don't know what it

3231
02:52:57,120 --> 02:53:04,240
did, but it recalibrated my body that it

3232
02:53:00,399 --> 02:53:07,760
would fit the gravity on Venus.

3233
02:53:04,240 --> 02:53:10,160
It was a like a thick creamy blue

3234
02:53:07,760 --> 02:53:12,399
liquid. U

3235
02:53:10,160 --> 02:53:17,680
clear blue, I don't remember. Yeah, kind

3236
02:53:12,399 --> 02:53:20,960
of creamy grayish blue. Um and uh didn't

3237
02:53:17,680 --> 02:53:24,960
taste really good, but um that's what I

3238
02:53:20,960 --> 02:53:26,640
am experienced.

3239
02:53:24,960 --> 02:53:31,200
Um

3240
02:53:26,640 --> 02:53:33,279
okay, let's go. Victoria Nagazaki.

3241
02:53:31,200 --> 02:53:35,920
Hello Victoria

3242
02:53:33,279 --> 02:53:37,840
10. We managed to arrive to 10. Hello

3243
02:53:35,920 --> 02:53:40,000
beautiful Elena. A lot of people on the

3244
02:53:37,840 --> 02:53:43,040
internet are talking about Anis the

3245
02:53:40,000 --> 02:53:45,359
third brother of Enki and Enlil and

3246
02:53:43,040 --> 02:53:47,279
about Alalu the first Anunnaki who came

3247
02:53:45,359 --> 02:53:50,560
to earth.

3248
02:53:47,279 --> 02:53:53,040
I think they got that from Sichin right

3249
02:53:50,560 --> 02:53:56,160
because that's not the case. That's not

3250
02:53:53,040 --> 02:53:57,680
right. I would like to know what you

3251
02:53:56,160 --> 02:53:59,520
think.

3252
02:53:57,680 --> 02:54:02,319
Thank you

3253
02:53:59,520 --> 02:54:03,840
in advance with great respect.

3254
02:54:02,319 --> 02:54:05,920
Um

3255
02:54:03,840 --> 02:54:08,319
yes. Okay. you want next time I come to

3256
02:54:05,920 --> 02:54:12,560
Japan. Yes, I'll make an announcement.

3257
02:54:08,319 --> 02:54:14,800
Okay. Um

3258
02:54:12,560 --> 02:54:16,720
no, I hasn't told me about these things.

3259
02:54:14,800 --> 02:54:18,640
So, um and I didn't know there was all

3260
02:54:16,720 --> 02:54:20,560
these discretion you don't follow any

3261
02:54:18,640 --> 02:54:23,200
online. I don't have time. So, I don't

3262
02:54:20,560 --> 02:54:25,600
know. So, um I would have told me about

3263
02:54:23,200 --> 02:54:29,560
these things. So, um I'm not able to

3264
02:54:25,600 --> 02:54:29,560
give an answer to this.

3265
02:54:29,840 --> 02:54:32,840
Um,

3266
02:54:33,279 --> 02:54:37,600
Johnny G. Hi Lena, thank you for your

3267
02:54:35,680 --> 02:54:39,279
time. You talked about Blu from another

3268
02:54:37,600 --> 02:54:41,359
timeline.

3269
02:54:39,279 --> 02:54:43,520
Do you mean that Blu is from future or

3270
02:54:41,359 --> 02:54:47,479
past?

3271
02:54:43,520 --> 02:54:47,479
When did I say that?

3272
02:54:47,680 --> 02:54:55,600
Oh, not timeline. Universe. Universe.

3273
02:54:51,680 --> 02:54:58,240
Yes. Uh the the blu was brought by the

3274
02:54:55,600 --> 02:55:01,279
nebu from another universe, another

3275
02:54:58,240 --> 02:55:05,439
bubble universe, another dimension. Yes.

3276
02:55:01,279 --> 02:55:07,520
Um that's it.

3277
02:55:05,439 --> 02:55:11,680
Um

3278
02:55:07,520 --> 02:55:13,520
Shantal. Oh yes. Okay. Okay. Shantal

3279
02:55:11,680 --> 02:55:15,600
Bas.

3280
02:55:13,520 --> 02:55:17,279
Dearena, it is interesting that when we

3281
02:55:15,600 --> 02:55:19,439
are in a state of bliss, the notion of

3282
02:55:17,279 --> 02:55:21,920
time and space disappears. Yes. You're

3283
02:55:19,439 --> 02:55:25,120
in a time field.

3284
02:55:21,920 --> 02:55:27,600
Time space consciousness time space

3285
02:55:25,120 --> 02:55:32,800
consciousness

3286
02:55:27,600 --> 02:55:34,960
eternity infinity oneness.

3287
02:55:32,800 --> 02:55:38,520
That's what bliss is experiencing these

3288
02:55:34,960 --> 02:55:38,520
three things.

3289
02:55:38,800 --> 02:55:43,359
There is just a reality of the moment

3290
02:55:40,880 --> 02:55:46,800
when where you feel complete, free,

3291
02:55:43,359 --> 02:55:48,640
connected and peace. At peace our time

3292
02:55:46,800 --> 02:55:50,720
and space a construct of the mind

3293
02:55:48,640 --> 02:55:52,720
vanishing as we raise frequencies. Thank

3294
02:55:50,720 --> 02:55:54,479
you always and much love. Oh, very

3295
02:55:52,720 --> 02:55:56,960
enlightened question. Enlightened

3296
02:55:54,479 --> 02:55:58,960
question. Are time and space a construct

3297
02:55:56,960 --> 02:56:00,479
of the mind vanishing as a raise

3298
02:55:58,960 --> 02:56:03,040
frequencies?

3299
02:56:00,479 --> 02:56:05,520
I would say

3300
02:56:03,040 --> 02:56:08,800
time and space are not a construct of

3301
02:56:05,520 --> 02:56:13,200
the mind. But time and space are

3302
02:56:08,800 --> 02:56:16,319
experienced by the mind differently

3303
02:56:13,200 --> 02:56:20,120
as we raise frequency.

3304
02:56:16,319 --> 02:56:20,120
That's what I would say.

3305
02:56:21,680 --> 02:56:28,800
It's a marathon questions.

3306
02:56:26,000 --> 02:56:30,880
Edlin USA,

3307
02:56:28,800 --> 02:56:33,600
greetings, Elena. How can we in the

3308
02:56:30,880 --> 02:56:38,200
present recreate our past for a brighter

3309
02:56:33,600 --> 02:56:38,200
future? Thank you.

3310
02:56:39,200 --> 02:56:43,840
I spoke about how to modify the past to

3311
02:56:41,279 --> 02:56:45,600
modify the present.

3312
02:56:43,840 --> 02:56:48,479
The secret is to modify the present

3313
02:56:45,600 --> 02:56:51,760
directly. You have this power with your

3314
02:56:48,479 --> 02:56:54,640
thoughts. Your thoughts emit

3315
02:56:51,760 --> 02:56:57,200
electrical impulses that are carrier

3316
02:56:54,640 --> 02:57:00,640
waves that carry information. And this

3317
02:56:57,200 --> 02:57:03,920
electrical impulse is going to

3318
02:57:00,640 --> 02:57:05,520
entangle interfere with the hologram of

3319
02:57:03,920 --> 02:57:07,680
reality.

3320
02:57:05,520 --> 02:57:09,840
And the information that will be carried

3321
02:57:07,680 --> 02:57:15,040
by this impulse

3322
02:57:09,840 --> 02:57:17,359
will imprint the hologram and alter it.

3323
02:57:15,040 --> 02:57:20,720
Visualize, think how you want this world

3324
02:57:17,359 --> 02:57:24,479
to be and and change it by the the

3325
02:57:20,720 --> 02:57:25,920
simple strength power of your thought.

3326
02:57:24,479 --> 02:57:27,439
You don't need to go in the past to

3327
02:57:25,920 --> 02:57:30,479
change the present. You have the power

3328
02:57:27,439 --> 02:57:34,040
to change the present now and make the

3329
02:57:30,479 --> 02:57:34,040
future you want.

3330
02:57:37,040 --> 02:57:45,920
Listen, uh we nearly touch time. So um

3331
02:57:43,359 --> 02:57:48,960
I am going to oh Corin I'm going to

3332
02:57:45,920 --> 02:57:51,760
answer your question.

3333
02:57:48,960 --> 02:57:54,479
Corin Huer does the notion of time which

3334
02:57:51,760 --> 02:57:57,040
passes depends only on the time it takes

3335
02:57:54,479 --> 02:57:58,800
a planet to revolve around the sun

3336
02:57:57,040 --> 02:58:02,680
therefore on the planet or which we live

3337
02:57:58,800 --> 02:58:02,680
or it on its frequencies

3338
02:58:03,760 --> 02:58:08,880
both. Um

3339
02:58:06,319 --> 02:58:11,600
it's all about experience. That's the

3340
02:58:08,880 --> 02:58:13,840
experience of time that depends on the

3341
02:58:11,600 --> 02:58:16,479
the speed of the cycle, the orbital

3342
02:58:13,840 --> 02:58:21,160
cycle and also on the speed of vibration

3343
02:58:16,479 --> 02:58:21,160
of matter slash the density.

3344
02:58:22,000 --> 02:58:25,920
When you're happy, time flies. Yes, we

3345
02:58:24,319 --> 02:58:28,479
spoke about that. But contrary,

3346
02:58:25,920 --> 02:58:30,479
everything seems endless. Huge thank you

3347
02:58:28,479 --> 02:58:34,960
for everything beautiful, so full of

3348
02:58:30,479 --> 02:58:37,439
compassion. Thank you, Corin. And I um

3349
02:58:34,960 --> 02:58:39,200
give you back the compliment to you as

3350
02:58:37,439 --> 02:58:41,359
well.

3351
02:58:39,200 --> 02:58:43,920
Well,

3352
02:58:41,359 --> 02:58:46,560
we arrived at the end of this these

3353
02:58:43,920 --> 02:58:51,200
three hours

3354
02:58:46,560 --> 02:58:54,920
and uh it's me to to pick a question.

3355
02:58:51,200 --> 02:58:54,920
So, um

3356
02:58:59,760 --> 02:59:05,359
Elena Oh, this one just

3357
02:59:03,520 --> 02:59:09,279
caught my mind and I'm going to answer

3358
02:59:05,359 --> 02:59:12,720
because it's calling to me. Kristoff E.

3359
02:59:09,279 --> 02:59:14,399
Dear Elena, what is eternity?

3360
02:59:12,720 --> 02:59:16,560
My gratitude for your commitment to

3361
02:59:14,399 --> 02:59:19,560
serving humanity with love from the

3362
02:59:16,560 --> 02:59:19,560
Netherlands.

3363
02:59:22,240 --> 02:59:29,000
This will be the last um answer. So,

3364
02:59:25,120 --> 02:59:29,000
what is eternity?

3365
02:59:32,160 --> 02:59:37,240
Eternity

3366
02:59:33,760 --> 02:59:37,240
is a tangent.

3367
02:59:37,680 --> 02:59:42,319
It goes to a point

3368
02:59:40,399 --> 02:59:47,000
of ending

3369
02:59:42,319 --> 02:59:47,000
without never touching it.

3370
02:59:47,200 --> 02:59:53,920
It goes so close, so close but never

3371
02:59:49,520 --> 02:59:57,920
touches it. And same

3372
02:59:53,920 --> 02:59:59,920
about the point of beginning.

3373
02:59:57,920 --> 03:00:01,760
It will never touch the point of

3374
02:59:59,920 --> 03:00:04,399
beginning because there was never a

3375
03:00:01,760 --> 03:00:08,080
point of beginning. Point of beginning

3376
03:00:04,399 --> 03:00:12,399
and a point of ending are abstract.

3377
03:00:08,080 --> 03:00:14,399
And eternity now it's not a line, it's a

3378
03:00:12,399 --> 03:00:17,040
field.

3379
03:00:14,399 --> 03:00:21,160
Eternity is about time.

3380
03:00:17,040 --> 03:00:21,160
Our souls are eternal.

3381
03:00:21,520 --> 03:00:25,279
Sure, there are cycles because they

3382
03:00:23,680 --> 03:00:28,160
incarnate

3383
03:00:25,279 --> 03:00:30,319
to evolve. But when they finish the

3384
03:00:28,160 --> 03:00:34,160
cycle, when they feel the moment is

3385
03:00:30,319 --> 03:00:37,040
right, they return to source.

3386
03:00:34,160 --> 03:00:40,800
We remerge with creator

3387
03:00:37,040 --> 03:00:42,960
with all that we have learned and

3388
03:00:40,800 --> 03:00:44,560
experienced and we merge back to the

3389
03:00:42,960 --> 03:00:48,160
creator

3390
03:00:44,560 --> 03:00:49,680
and the creator shoots again.

3391
03:00:48,160 --> 03:00:54,160
Consciousness

3392
03:00:49,680 --> 03:00:56,479
can be you again starting a new cycle

3393
03:00:54,160 --> 03:01:01,000
can be

3394
03:00:56,479 --> 03:01:01,000
someone else can be something else.

3395
03:01:01,840 --> 03:01:08,120
As we go, we approach source, we lose

3396
03:01:05,120 --> 03:01:08,120
individuality.

3397
03:01:08,640 --> 03:01:13,920
Same as as when we come from source, we

3398
03:01:11,279 --> 03:01:19,479
embrace ini individuality

3399
03:01:13,920 --> 03:01:19,479
through our journey down through matter.

3400
03:01:20,880 --> 03:01:26,399
Source radiates outwards from the

3401
03:01:24,560 --> 03:01:29,120
highest density towards the lowest

3402
03:01:26,399 --> 03:01:31,200
density. that

3403
03:01:29,120 --> 03:01:33,840
what is

3404
03:01:31,200 --> 03:01:35,840
above can influence what is under but

3405
03:01:33,840 --> 03:01:37,840
not the contrary.

3406
03:01:35,840 --> 03:01:42,640
Eternity

3407
03:01:37,840 --> 03:01:44,960
is also cycles but these cycles are of

3408
03:01:42,640 --> 03:01:49,520
coming back to source and being shoot

3409
03:01:44,960 --> 03:01:51,680
again are also included

3410
03:01:49,520 --> 03:01:54,399
in a nonending

3411
03:01:51,680 --> 03:01:56,000
and non-binning

3412
03:01:54,399 --> 03:01:58,000
time.

3413
03:01:56,000 --> 03:02:03,960
Eternity

3414
03:01:58,000 --> 03:02:03,960
is the field, the quantum time field.

3415
03:02:06,080 --> 03:02:12,080
And I encourage you to through your

3416
03:02:08,399 --> 03:02:14,399
meditation, through experience,

3417
03:02:12,080 --> 03:02:16,640
to lift your consciousness out of your

3418
03:02:14,399 --> 03:02:19,359
body.

3419
03:02:16,640 --> 03:02:22,359
And once you're out of it, contemplating

3420
03:02:19,359 --> 03:02:22,359
space,

3421
03:02:23,520 --> 03:02:29,840
immerse yourself in the knowing to be in

3422
03:02:26,319 --> 03:02:34,000
the quantum time field,

3423
03:02:29,840 --> 03:02:37,520
in the quantum time space and in one in

3424
03:02:34,000 --> 03:02:40,240
the one consciousness.

3425
03:02:37,520 --> 03:02:42,319
Be the one consciousness.

3426
03:02:40,240 --> 03:02:44,479
Be the field.

3427
03:02:42,319 --> 03:02:47,680
Be the infinity.

3428
03:02:44,479 --> 03:02:50,920
Be eternal. be infinite,

3429
03:02:47,680 --> 03:02:50,920
be one.

3430
03:02:52,560 --> 03:02:59,120
And on these words,

3431
03:02:55,840 --> 03:03:01,439
my beloved ones

3432
03:02:59,120 --> 03:03:04,240
from all my heart,

3433
03:03:01,439 --> 03:03:08,160
from the heart of an old soul who came

3434
03:03:04,240 --> 03:03:12,319
to earth 400,000 years ago

3435
03:03:08,160 --> 03:03:16,760
and has been coming back to help you and

3436
03:03:12,319 --> 03:03:16,760
guide you and be your friend.

3437
03:03:16,880 --> 03:03:23,439
I am wishing you

3438
03:03:21,279 --> 03:03:25,520
to see

3439
03:03:23,439 --> 03:03:28,399
the power

3440
03:03:25,520 --> 03:03:30,240
that you have.

3441
03:03:28,399 --> 03:03:33,240
The power that you have, it's your

3442
03:03:30,240 --> 03:03:33,240
consciousness.

3443
03:03:33,600 --> 03:03:40,720
You are beautiful.

3444
03:03:36,160 --> 03:03:43,720
You are eternal. And you are one with

3445
03:03:40,720 --> 03:03:43,720
creator.

3446
03:03:44,640 --> 03:03:49,240
See you next

3447
03:05:11,359 --> 03:05:17,319
Heat. Heat.

3448
03:05:14,319 --> 03:05:17,319
Heat. Heat.

3449
03:05:39,279 --> 03:05:42,279
Heat.

3450

Heat.

3451
03:06:00,960 --> 03:06:03,960
Heat.

3452
03:06:16,319 --> 03:06:19,319
Heat.

3453
03:06:34,479 --> 03:06:37,560
Heat up here.

3454
03:06:49,840 --> 03:06:52,840
Heat.

3455
03:07:05,600 --> 03:07:08,600
Heat.
